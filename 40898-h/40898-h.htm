<h2>I: The Friendly Club</h2>


<div class='cap'>A HARVARD man, not exempt from the
complacency sometimes attributed to
graduates of his university, once observed,
according to Barrett Wendell, that the group
of forgotten litterateurs, who toward the close
of the eighteenth century attained a brief measure
of fame as the "Hartford Wits," represents
the only considerable literary efflorescence
of Yale. The remark did not fail to provoke the
rejoinder, doubtless from a Yale source, that nevertheless
at the time when the Hartford Wits
flourished no Harvard man had produced literature
half so good as theirs.</div>

<p>How good this literature was considered in its
day is not readily understood by the modern
reader, for from the Hudibrastic imitations and
heroic couplets of these writers, whose brilliance
was dimmed so long ago, the contemporary flavor
has long since evaporated. Indeed there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
modern reader in the general sense. It is only
the antiquarian, the literary researcher, the casual
burrower among the shelves of some old library
who now opens these yellow pages and
follows for a few moments the stilted lines that
seem to him a diluted imitation of Pope, Goldsmith
and Butler. Professor Beers of Yale ventures
the surmise that he may be the only living
man who has read the whole of Joel Barlow's
"Columbiad."</p>

<p>Yet in their time this coterie of poets, who
gathered in the little Connecticut town after the
close of the war for independence, became famous
not only in their own land but abroad, and the
community where most of them lived and met
at their "friendly club"&mdash;was it at the Black
Horse Tavern or the "Bunch of Grapes"?&mdash;shone
in reflected glory as the literary center of
America. No Boswell was among them to record
the sparkling epigrams, the jovial give and
take, the profound "political and philosophical"
debates of those weekly gatherings. Yet imagination
loves to linger on the old friendships, the
patriotic aspirations, the common passion for
creative art, the wooing of the Muses of an older
world, thus dimly shadowed forth against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
background of the raw young country just embarking
on its mysterious experiment.</p>

<p>Do not doubt that these personages whose individualities
are now so effectually concealed behind
the veil of their sounding and artificial cantos
were real young men who cherished their
dreams and their hopes. One can see them gathered
around the great wood fire in the low ceiled
room redolent of tobacco, blazing hickory and
hot Jamaica rum.</p>

<p>Here is Trumbull, the lawyer, the author of
"M'Fingal" which everybody has read and which
has been published in England and honored with
the criticism of the Quarterly and Edinburgh
Reviews. He is a little man, rather frail, rather
nervous, not without impatience, with a ready
wit that sometimes bites deep. Here is Lemuel
Hopkins, the physician, whose lank body, long
nose and prominent eyes are outward manifestations
of his eccentric genius. His presence lends
a fillip to the gathering for he is an odd fish and
no one can tell what he will do or say next.
Threatened all his life with tuberculosis he is
nevertheless a man of great muscular strength
and during his days as a soldier he used to astonish
his comrades by his ability to fire a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
king's arm, held in one hand at arm's length.
In his verses he castigates shams and humbugs
of all kinds, whether the nostrums of medical
quacks or the irreverent vaporings of General
Ethan Allen&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Lo, Allen, 'scaped from British jails<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His tushes broke by biting nails,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Appears in hyperborean skies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To tell the world the Bible lies."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Perhaps Colonel David Humphreys, full of war
stories and anecdotes of his intimacy with General
Washington, on whose staff he served, is in
Hartford for the evening. A well dressed, hearty,
sophisticated traveler and man of the world is
Colonel Humphreys, who would be recognized at
first glance as a soldier, though not as a poet.
Nevertheless he is addicted to the writing of
verse which is apt to run in the vein of comedy or
burlesque when it is not earnestly patriotic. To
look at him one would know that he enjoys a
good dinner, a good story and a bottle of port.</p>

<p>We may be sure that Joel Barlow is here, the
vacillating, visionary Barlow who has tried, or
is to try his hand at many pursuits besides epic
poetry&mdash;the ministry, the law, bookselling, philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
journalism and diplomacy&mdash;but who is
pre-occupied now, as all his life, with his magnum
opus, "The Vision of Columbus," later elaborated
into "The Columbiad." He is a good looking,
if somewhat self-centered young man, a favorite
in the days of his New Haven residence with the
young ladies of that town. Perhaps it was there
that he first met the charming and talented Elizabeth
Whitman, the daughter of the Rev. Dr.
Elnathan Whitman, sometime pastor of the
South Congregational Church in Hartford, who
often visited her friend Betty Stiles, the daughter
of the president of Yale College. A few of
Elizabeth Whitman's letters that have survived&mdash;the
packet bearing an endorsement in Barlow's
handwriting&mdash;are evidence that he made her a
confidante of his literary schemes and hopes and
welcomed her assistance with his great epic. A
strong friendship and entire harmony seem to
have existed between her and Ruth Baldwin of
New Haven, whom Barlow married during the
war, and who is said to have "inspired in the
poet's breast a remarkable passion, one that survived
all the mutations of a most adventurous
career, and glowed as fervently at fifty as at
twenty-five." For nearly a year the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was kept a secret, but parental forgiveness was
at last secured and Barlow has now brought his
wife to Hartford where he is continuing his legal
studies, begun in his college town. But the law
will not engross him long. Soon, with his friend
Elisha Babcock, he is to start a new journal,
"The American Mercury," of which his editorship,
like all of Barlow's early enterprises, is to
be brief, though the paper is to continue till
1830.</p>

<p>A tall, slender man, Noah Webster by name,
a class-mate of Barlow at Yale, though four years
his junior, sits near him, relaxing for the moment
in the informality of these surroundings his
strangely intense powers of mental application,
divided just now between the law and the preparation
of his "Grammatical Institute." To the
"poetical effusions" of his friends he contributes
nothing, but he was an intimate of them all and
no doubt often attended their gatherings.</p>

<p>Perhaps, now and later, something of the poet's
license in the matter of chronology may be
granted. Let us assume, then, that young Dr.
Mason Cogswell is in town for a day or two,
looking over the ground with a view of settling
here in the practice of medicine and surgery in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which he is now engaged at Stamford, after his
training in New York where he served with his
brother James at the soldiers' hospital. It is
true that the fragments of his diary, which by
a fortunate chance were rescued from destruction,
do not mention any visit to Hartford as
early as this, though his journal does describe a
short sojourn here a few years later. Still, his
presence is by no means impossible. He is a
companionable youth, as popular with the young
ladies as Barlow, but with an easier manner, a
readier humor. Delighted at this opportunity to
sit for an evening at the feet of the older celebrities,
he is a welcome guest, for already he has a
reputation for versatility and culture and the
fact that he was valedictorian of the Yale Class
of 1780&mdash;and its youngest member&mdash;is not forgotten.</p>

<p>Richard Alsop, book-worm, naturalist and linguist,
who is beginning to dip into verse, has
locked up his book shop for the night and is here.
Near him sits a man who is, or is soon to be, his
brother-in-law, a tall, dark youth, Theodore
Dwight, the brother of the more famous Timothy,
whose pastoral duties detain him at Greenfield
Hill, but who is sometimes numbered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
one of this group. Theodore is now studying law,
but he has a flair for writing and makes an occasional
adventure into the gazettes.</p>

<p>These more youthful aspirants have their spurs
to win. A little later they, with their friend Dr.
Elihu Smith, who published the first American
poetic anthology, are to get into print in a vein
of satirical verse ridiculing the prevalent literary
affectation and bombast. After journalistic publication
these satires will appear in book form
under the title of "The Echo," in the introduction
to which the anonymous authors state that
the poems "owed their origin to the accidental
suggestion of a moment of literary sportiveness."
"The Echo" was "Printed at the Porcupine Press
by Pasquin Petronius."</p>

<p>That particular sportive moment is still in the
future. Now it is sufficient for these younger men
to shine in the reflected luster of the established
luminaries. These greater lights are worthy indeed
of the worship of the lesser stars. Three of
them have achieved, or are soon to acquire, an
international as well as a national reputation.
That "M'Fingal" had provoked discussion in
England has been noted. Humphreys's "Address
to the Armies of America," written in camp at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Peekskill, and dedicated to the Duke de Rochefoucault,
was issued with an introductory letter
by the poet's friend, the Marquis de Chastellux,
in a French translation in Paris, after its publication
in England where the Monthly and Critical
Reviews gave it a fair amount of praise,
though they could not refrain from the statement
that the poem was "not a very pleasing one to a
good Englishman." Barlow's "Vision of Columbus"
was published almost simultaneously in
Hartford and London in 1787.</p>

<p>In short these men had attained a genuine intellectual
eminence in their generation. They
were the cognoscenti of their day. Like most
young intellectuals their gospel concerned itself
with reform, with the ridicule of shams, with
the refusal to accept the popularity of new doctrines
as a final test of their value. Trumbull and
Barlow, both Yale graduates, had fought with
their friend Timothy Dwight their first reform
campaign which was an effort to introduce into
the somewhat archaic and outworn body of the
Yale curriculum the breath of the humanities
and of modern thought. Trumbull, according to
Moses Coit Tyler, was an example of a "new
tone coming into American letters&mdash;urbanity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
perspective, moderation of emphasis, satire, especially
on its more playful side&mdash;that of irony."</p>

<p>Their interests were not only literary. They
were publicists, political satirists, social philosophers,
not without their religious theories. In
all these matters their search was for the true
standards and as champions of causes and enthusiasts
of ideals they exhibited a variation from
type in that their warfare was waged, not against
the recognized conventions in government, religion
and society, but in favor of them. Priding
themselves on untrammelled and direct thinking,
their reasoning led them to support the established,
the orderly, the stable. Temperamentally
aristocrats, theoretically republicans&mdash;in
the broad sense of the term&mdash;they were practically
federalists. "The Anarchiad," a series of
poems they were contributing anonymously
about this time to "The New Haven Gazette,"
dealt satirically with the dangers of national unrest
and instability, of selfish aggrandizement
and of a fictitious currency. In these verses Hesper
addresses "the Sages and Counsellors at
Philadelphia" as follows:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"But know, ye favor'd race, one potent head<br />
Must rule your States, and strike your foes with dread."<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the same passage occur some lines, attributed
to Hopkins, that Daniel Webster may

<p>They ridiculed unsparingly the dangers hidden
under the cloak of "Democracy"&mdash;dangers imminent
and menacing in the days following the end
of the war in which most of them had served. In
fighting these perils they were sagacious in making
use of the means frequently employed by advocates
of radicalism&mdash;invective, irony and ridicule.
For these methods secured, as they naturally
would secure if cleverly managed, a wide
appeal. Yet the efficiency of such weapons depends
very largely upon the occasion. Their potency
is contemporary with the events against
which they are directed and with the passing
years their force weakens. Who reads nowadays
the political diatribes of Swift, the tracts of Defoe,
or the letters of Junius? Here perhaps is in
part an explanation of the great temporary influence
of the Hartford Wits, as well as of their
complete modern obscuration. The brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
blade they wielded had a biting edge, but the
rust of a century and a half has dulled it.</p>

<p>This general leaning toward the established
canons, this impatience with the new doctrines
that in the judgment of these men made for disunion
and disaster, should be qualified, at least
in the religious aspect, in two interesting particulars,
each contradictory to the other. Hopkins
began adult life as a sceptic but became a defender
of the Christian philosophy. Barlow, on
the other hand, deserted in later life the orthodox
ideals of his youth, never, perhaps, very
enthusiastically championed, and during his
sojourn in France became a rationalist and free-thinker.</p>

<p>In general, however, the Hartford Wits fought
for the established order against the forces of
innovation and disintegration and thus when
they sat down to unburden their minds of their
visions of their country's future greatness, or of
their impatience with demagoguery and political
short-sightedness, it was natural that their sense
of tradition and order should lead their thoughts
to seek expression in the verse forms lifted into
fame by the masters of an older and greater literature
and accepted as the conventional vehicle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of poetic expression. Here is another reason, if
they must be catalogued, for the forgetfulness
of the Hartford Wits. These balanced, formal
lines, so expressive of the artificial modes and
manners of the subjects of Queen Anne and her
successors, are to us prosy, old-fashioned and
imitative. Their charm has fled. Can you imagine
Miss Amy Lowell reading Hudibras? And
we must admit that "M'Fingal," though it has
given to literature some still remembered aphorisms,
such as&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"No man e'er felt the halter draw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With good opinion of the law"&mdash;</span><br />

<p>It is significant that the distinction of the individuals
united in the "friendly club" was not
confined to their literary activities. In an age
sometimes esteemed narrow and limited in its
cultural aspects they are refreshing in their versatility.
Trumbull was a well-known lawyer and
served on the bench for eighteen years, part of
his legal training having been pursued in the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of John Adams. It was a strange combination,
not unprecedented but nevertheless arresting,
of this talent for the law associated with
the artistic temperament. For with all his practical
attributes Trumbull was essentially an artist.
His early poem entitled "An Ode to Sleep,"
says Tyler, "is a composition resonant of noble
and sweet music and making, if one may say so,
a nearer approach to genuine poetry than had
then [1773] been achieved by any living American
except Freneau." And in the following bit of
autobiography, quoted by Tyler, may be discerned
the self-distrust and depression to which
no soul that longs and strives for the beautiful
in this imperfect world is entirely a stranger:
"Formed with the keenest sensibility and the
most extravagantly romantic feelings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
was born the dupe of imagination. My satirical
turn was not native. It was produced by the
keen spirit of critical observation, operating on
disappointed expectation, and revenging itself on
real or fancied wrongs."</p>

<p>This is an extraordinary item of self-revelation
to come from a man who at various times held
office as State's Attorney for Hartford County,
member of the General Assembly and Judge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the Superior and Supreme Courts of his State.
It may not be an entirely fanciful surmise to attribute
a partial cause of the delicate health that
followed Trumbull all his long life to the warring
elements that strove to unite in his brilliant
mentality.</p>

<p>With Dr. Hopkins poetizing was distinctly a
by-product. His chief concern was the practice
of medicine and in his profession he won a reputation
that is not entirely forgotten today by
members of the faculty, for he was probably the
first American physician to assert that tuberculosis
was curable and his success as a specialist
in this field was so marked that, says Dr. Walter
R. Steiner in a monograph upon him, "patients
with this disease came to him for treatment from
a great distance&mdash;one being recorded to have
made the trip all the way from New Orleans."
In his treatment he was unique in his day in very
largely discarding the use of drugs and relying
more upon pure air, good diet and moderate exercise
when strength permitted. His theory that
fresh air was better for colds than the warm air
of houses was revolutionary, but so was almost
everything he did&mdash;or so it seemed to his contemporaries.
At one time he evidently considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that New York City might offer a wider field of
practice than the Connecticut capital, for in December,
1789, Trumbull wrote to Oliver Wolcott,
"Dr. Hopkins has an itch of running away
to New York, but I trust his indolence will prevent
him. However if you should catch him in
your city, I desire you to take him up or secure
him so that we may have him again, for which
you shall have sixpence reward and all charges."
In spite of his malady he lived till almost fifty-one,
dying in April, 1801, the head of the medical
profession in Connecticut.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that though Dr. Cogswell was
one of the chief contributors to "The Echo" his
main business in life was as a surgeon rather than
a poet, and he became one of the most skillful
surgical practitioners in the country, being the
first to introduce into the United States the operation
for cataracts and the first to tie the carotid
artery. Closely associated with him is the pathetic
memory of his daughter Alice who became
stone deaf in early childhood and whose infirmity
led to the establishment at Hartford of the first
school in this country for the education of the
deaf. Of this institution Dr. Cogswell was one
of the founders and he was a leader in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
philanthropic enterprises. He lived till 1830. To
the last he wore the knee breeches and silk stockings
customary in his youth and which he considered
the only proper dress for a gentleman.
His death broke the heart of his daughter Alice,
to whom he had been a never-failing protection
and support, and she died within a fortnight
after her father.</p>

<p>In contrast with the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'activites'">activities</ins> of their colleagues,
the careers of Theodore Dwight and
Alsop are associated solely with the product of
their pens. Dwight, however, was more of a publicist
and editor than a creative literary worker.
He had the brains with which nature had endowed
his family and his history of the unjustly
maligned Hartford Convention is a thoughtful
and able piece of work&mdash;an original historical
document that is illuminating and suggestive.
Such distinction as Alsop attained was strictly
literary, yet one gets the impression that he
worked at writing rather as an amateur than a
professional. He was really a student, a scholar,
a research worker, and seems to have sought his
reward more in the pleasure of following his interests
than in the quest of public recognition.
Much that he wrote was never published.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a great deal in life that Colonel
Humphreys enjoyed besides composing verses and
a great many activities other than poetry for
which he may be remembered. Not the least hint
of any paralyzing self-distrust, no subtle questionings
as to whether it was all worth while, disturbed
his equanimity. And fate rewarded his
zest in life by furnishing him with a variety of
experiences. They began in the war from which
he emerged with a reputation for gallantry and
daring and, what was perhaps more valuable,
with the firm friendship of George Washington.
He participated in the raid into Sag Harbor by
Colonel Meigs in '77 and the next year raided the
Long Island shore on his own account, burning
three enemy ships and getting away without the
loss of a man. It was only a freak of the weather
that perhaps withheld from him a more glorious
exploit for on Christmas night, 1780, he headed
a desperate venture that had for its object no
less an achievement than the capture of Sir
Henry Clinton at his headquarters in New York.
The rising of the wintry northwest gale drove
the boats of the little group of adventurers away
from the intended landing near the foot of Broadway
and swept them down through the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
shipping in the harbor to Sandy Hook. After
Yorktown he was ordered by Washington to
carry the captured colors to Congress which in
the enthusiasm of the moment voted him a handsome
sword.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"See Humphreys, glorious from the field retire.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sheathe the glad sword and string the sounding lyre,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>wrote Barlow in his "Vision of Columbus," The
lyre accompanied songs in praise of his country,
tributes to his commander-in-chief, political satires,
and even love lyrics&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Enough with war my lay has sung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A softer theme awakes my tongue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Tis beauty's force divine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Can I resist that air, that grace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The charms of motion, figure, face?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For ev'ry charm is thine."</span><br />
</div>

<p>But this was by the way. Appointed secretary
to the commission, consisting of Franklin, John
Adams and Jefferson, sent to negotiate treaties
of commerce and amity with European nations,
he no doubt thoroughly enjoyed his two years in
London and Paris. In theory the nobility of
Europe may have been anathema to a patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
citizen of a republic, but practically there were
many persons among them whose acquaintance
was agreeable to an amiable and gallant gentleman
of sensibility like Colonel Humphreys and
there was, no doubt, a certain gratification in
dedicating one's poems to a duke and in having
them reviewed by a marquis who incidentally
disclosed the fact that he was an old companion
in arms. Also it was pleasant to be elected a
fellow of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>On Colonel Humphreys's return he spent some
time as a member of the family at Mount Vernon
where Washington encouraged him in his
project of writing a history of the war which,
however, never got any further in print than a
memorial of his old general, Putnam. At Mount
Vernon he wrote an ode celebrating his great and
good friend whose friendship we may reasonably
infer constituted one of his chief conversational
assets:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Let others sing his deeds in arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A nation sav'd, and conquest's charms:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Posterity shall hear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Twas mine, return'd from Europe's courts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To share his thoughts, partake his sports</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">And sooth his partial ear."</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>It is clear that European life had its attractions
for Colonel Humphreys. At all events he
returned to it, serving as minister to Portugal
and later to Spain whence he imported his famous
merino sheep to his acres at Humphreysville,
now Seymour. Here, and in the adjoining town
of Derby, he projected and to a creditable extent
realized, an ideal patriarchal manufacturing and
farming community, instructing his operatives
and husbandmen in improved industrial methods,
in scientific agriculture and stock raising, athletics,
poetry and the drama in which one of his
productions was actually presented on the stage.
At least he accomplished his wish, voiced in his
poem "On the Industry of the United States of
America"&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>

<div class='center'><br />iii</div>

<p>Though the friends grouped around the tavern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fire are united in two sympathetic qualities&mdash;devotion
to the Muses and a proud conviction,
singularly justified by events, of the destiny of
their country&mdash;it is manifest that the membership
of the little club furnishes only another illustration
of the truism that human personality
is the most varying thing in the world and that
life has different lessons for each of us. The most
baffling individuality of them all, the man whose
story seems to have been a quest for some mysterious,
unattained goal, was Joel Barlow.</p>

<p>In early life everything he attempted went to
pieces. His chaplaincy in the army was a <i>tour de
force</i> which he dropped as soon as possible. The
law proved a mistake almost as soon as begun
and his editorship of "The American Mercury"
was abandoned after less than a year. Perhaps it
was with renewed hope, perhaps it was with
something of desperation, that he persuaded himself
to embark on an entirely new undertaking
and to accept a proposal to journey overseas to
procure settlers for the Ohio lands which the
Scioto Land Company desired to sell to unsuspecting
Frenchmen. It is an established fact that
Barlow was unsuspecting himself, but after he
had procured the settlers and shipped them off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with golden promises the project turned out to
be a gigantic fraud. Personal humiliation was
added to general discouragement. Yet somehow
he survived the mortification. It may be that at
this particular time mundane affairs did not seem
to be of the utmost importance. He was dwelling
somewhat in the clouds, in a vision&mdash;the "Vision
of Columbus," which he proposed to amplify and
republish in a form more fitting the great theme
than the first modest edition of the original poem.
He was pre-occupied with the millenium he foresaw.</p>

<p>To the present day reader it is of the highest
interest to note that the "Vision" foretold the
Panama Canal, and that the climax of the poem
is a congress of the nations.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Hither the delegated sires ascend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all the cares of every clime attend.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">.&nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To give each realm its limits and its laws</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bid the last breath of dire contention cease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And bind all regions in the leagues of peace."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Indeed with the break-down of his career as a
promoter the tide began to turn. Barlow's friends
knew he was innocent of complicity in the land
swindle. In Paris he found himself at last in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
environment where freedom of thought was encouraged,
where the ambitions of a poet were
regarded with respect and admiration. He was
always an idealist and he caught the contagion
in the mental atmosphere of Paris as the revolution
came on. Perhaps it seemed to him that
his dream of the millenium was coming true.
He became a Girondist and a political writer,
supporting himself mainly by his pen, with the
re-writing of the "Vision" always in the back of
his mind. Was this the real Barlow&mdash;or was it a
phase, a manifestation of a kind of philosophic
idealism, fostered by the air of Paris, so favorable
to the blossoming of this new flower of liberty
and universal human brotherhood which
centered on France the minds of all the dreamers
of the world?</p>

<p>What did he now think, we wonder, of his
dedication of the first edition of his epic, published
the year before he sailed for France, to
Louis the Sixteenth whom, as one commentator
has noted, he soon indirectly assisted in sending
to the guillotine? He had gone a long way from
the militant conservatism of the brilliant companions
of his youth&mdash;from the days when he
had preached the gospel to American soldiers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had collaborated with Timothy Dwight, at the
request of the General Association of the Connecticut
Clergy, in getting out an edition of Isaac
Watts's metrical versions of the Psalms&mdash;to
which he had added a few poetical renderings
of his own.</p>

<p>For the following years his residence alternated
between Paris and London where he found
congenial souls among the artists and poets who
were members of the Constitutional Society. His
"Advice to the Privileged Orders" was attacked
by Burke, praised by Fox, proscribed by the
British government and translated into French
and German. In 1792 he presented to the National
Convention of France a treatise on government
which was in fact a remarkable state
paper, combining profound philosophic theories
of government with practical administrative and
executive suggestions. As a result he was made
a citizen of France&mdash;an honor he shared among
Americans with only Washington and Hamilton.</p>

<p>Defeat for election as a deputy from Savoy
and his repugnance to the excesses of the Revolution
appear to have thrown him out of practical
politics for a time. And then a strange thing
happened. This visionary poet and idealist attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to retrieve his fortunes in commerce and
speculation and actually succeeded. During his
consulship at Algiers, from which he anticipated
he might never return, he left a letter for his
wife in which he stated that his estate might
amount to one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars if French funds rose to par.</p>

<p>This appointment came to him in a pleasant
way. One day in the summer of 1795 he returned
from a business trip to the Low Countries to find
an old friend waiting for him. Colonel Humphreys,
now minister at Lisbon, had arrived at
the request of the administration to ask Barlow
to accept this mission to Algiers where for a year
and a half he was to labor, succeeding in the end
in liberating imprisoned countrymen and in effecting
a treaty that composed troublesome difficulties.</p>

<p>It must have been an interesting reunion.
Humphreys was too much of a cosmopolitan, too
generous in spirit, to make Barlow's growing liberalism
of thought a personal grievance. Here
for the exiled American was first-hand news of
the old Connecticut friends&mdash;that Trumbull, between
ill health and the pressure of public affairs,
was neglecting the Muses; that Noah Webster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was said to be working on a great lexicon; that
Dr. Cogswell had settled in Hartford and married
a daughter of Colonel William Ledyard who
was killed at Fort Griswold with his own sword
in the act of surrender; that a play by Dr. Elihu
Smith had been acted at the John Street Theatre
in New York; that Timothy Dwight would probably
succeed Dr. Stiles as President of Yale&mdash;and
much besides. Very likely Humphreys confided
to his friend his growing interest in Miss Ann
Bulkley, an English heiress, whom he had met
in Lisbon and who soon afterward was to become
his wife, and Barlow no doubt found a sympathetic
listener to his great project of enlarging
and re-publishing the "Vision."</p>

<p>His return from Algiers found French consols
rising with the Napoleonic successes and Barlow
lived as became a man of wealth and distinction.
Robert Fulton, who made his home with him,
painted his portrait in the intervals of experimenting
with submarine boats and torpedoes in
the Seine and the harbor at Brest. Indeed Barlow
had now acquired so strong an influence with
the Directory and the French people that his biographer
attributes to him the chief part in averting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
war between France and the United States in
the tense days after 1798.</p>

<p>Then followed a return to his own country
where he had an ambition to found a national
institution for education and the advancement
of science. He built a beautiful home, not in
New England, be it noted, but near Washington&mdash;the
"Holland House of America"&mdash;and began,
but never finished, a history of the United States.
He did, however, at last complete "The Columbiad,"
which was published in Philadelphia in
1807&mdash;"the finest specimen of book-making ever
produced in America."</p>

<p>Did the great moment hold something of disillusion
and disappointment, when, amid the
somewhat perfunctory adulation, came the bitter
criticism of the Federalists and the expressed conviction
of some of his old Yale and Hartford
friends that he was an apostate in politics and
religion? To him it was clear that they did not
understand. How could it be expected that Timothy
Dwight, for example, the grandson of Jonathan
Edwards, with all of New England's conservatism
and provincialism in his blood, could
understand? Yet Barlow's ancestral background
was the same&mdash;but who can fathom the depths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of personality, or solve the complexity of motive
and aspiration?</p>

<p>Perhaps there were times when the returned
wanderer grew homesick for Paris. At last the
chance to return to the land that had adopted
him came&mdash;a chance for notable service in an
honorable capacity. War was again in the air
and in 1811 Barlow went back to France as minister
plenipotentiary, charged with the duty of
again averting conflict and negotiating a treaty
embodying a settlement of the differences.</p>

<p>In the French capital he took his old house.
His old servants came back to him with tears of
joy. Old friends gathered about him. It was not
easy, however, to clinch the treaty. The Emperor
was involved in momentous affairs. The
Russian expedition was on foot. The ministers
procrastinated. There is an intimation in the
record that the poet and political theorist was
out-maneuvered in the negotiations by players
of a game that had nothing to do with poetry or
abstract questions but that concerned itself, persistently
and relentlessly, with very definite but
not entirely obvious purposes. Yet it does not
seem that this inference is conclusively supported
by the evidence. However that may be, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
given out that Barlow had secured, and he unquestionably
believed that he had secured, an
agreement as to the provisions of the proposed
treaty. At any rate the Emperor consented to
meet the American envoy if he would come to
Vilna in West Russia.</p>

<p>So in that dreary winter he set out with a high
hope of achieving his greatest service to his country,
but what would have happened at Vilna we
shall never know, for on Barlow's approach to
that town an incredible and stupendous piece of
news awaited him. The invincible Grand Army
was retreating, apparently in some demoralization.
Everything was in confusion. Where the
Emperor was, no one knew. Obviously nothing
could now be done and the American minister
started to return.</p>

<p>Somewhere on those frozen roads the Emperor
passed him, racing for Paris to save his dynasty
and himself. In the exposure and hardship Barlow
fell ill. At the little village of Zarnovich,
near Cracow, it became evident that he could
travel no further and there, in the midst of that
historic cataclysm, he died.</p>

<p>It was a strange ending for one of the old
Hartford coterie. In the clairvoyance said sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to accompany the supreme moment did he
realize that if his great epic might not live forever
he had at least given form in his day to a
dream of which civilization would never let go?
Did any intimation come to him that his "Ode
to Hasty Pudding," written off-hand at a Savoyard
inn, held more real emotion than all the
balanced cadences of his monumental work? No
doubt his delirious fancies sometimes went back
to the old days. Perhaps he saw once more the
faces of his old companions of the friendly club,
not clouded now with misunderstanding or disapproval.
From beyond the frosted panes came
intermittently the confused noises of the great
retreat, with all their implications of selfish ambition,
human suffering and the continual warfare
of the world. Was his belief in the final triumph
of the fraternity of mankind shaken by that sinister
monotone? It is idle to conjecture, but let
us hope that he was comforted by a lingering
faith, revived in this hour of his extremity from
the days of his youth, that he would soon learn
as to the truth of his vision and that he would
find as well the answers to the other riddles that
had puzzled him all his life.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a><br /><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a><br /><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a><br /><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>




<h2>II: The Mystery of the
Bell Tavern</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE investigator of early American fiction
will find that a peculiar interest attaches
to two novels, both published in the last decade
of the eighteenth century, both following Richardson
in their epistolary form and both founded
on fact.</div>

<p>One of these was called "Charlotte Temple,
or a Tale of Truth." In the graveyard of Trinity
Church in New York, at the head of Wall Street,
is a large stone, flush with the ground, bearing
the name of the heroine of this now forgotten
story which in its day attained an astonishing
popularity. The tale is of a young girl who
during the War of the American Revolution
eloped from an English school with a British
officer who abandoned her in New York where
she died soon after the birth of a daughter. The
tradition runs that more than a century ago the
daughter, grown to womanhood, caused her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
mother's body to be removed to an English
churchyard, but the stone still marks the first
resting place and when the writer last saw it
two wreaths lay upon it.</p>

<p>In 1797&mdash;seven years after the date of the
first edition of "Charlotte Temple"&mdash;the second
of our two novels appeared. It was called "The
Coquette" and was written by Mrs. Hannah
Foster, the wife of a Brighton, Massachusetts,
minister. For many years it was read and re-read
throughout the country, the latest edition
appearing in 1866. Like "Charlotte Temple"
its theme was the tragedy of abandonment. It
seems, indeed, that the writer who wished to
intrigue the interest of our ancestors of this
period was compelled to hang his plot on the
judiciously interwoven threads of sentiment
and gloom. Perhaps no further proof of this is
needed than the example of Charles Brockden
Brown's portentous and sinister romances, with
their undeniable flashes of genius. But it is
well to remember, too, that these were the days
when "The Castle of Otranto," "Clarissa
Harlowe," and "The Vicar of Wakefield" were
all popular, and all exhibited varying phases of
the literary vogue of the day. In other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
though the prevailing mode of thought found
expression in different forms, the imaginative
impulses beneath the various manifestations
were the same.</p>

<p>Therefore it is not surprising to find little
relief from the tragic note in "The Coquette."
It is true that the author endeavors to present
the heroine, Eliza Wharton, as a worldly and
volatile young woman, but these touches of
lightness have lost with the passing years whatever
approaches to polite comedy they may
have once implied. One must confess that regarded
strictly as a piece of fiction the book
makes rather hard reading today. But examined
with some knowledge of the mystery upon
which it is founded, the old novel becomes a
genuine human document.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster was a family connection of Elizabeth
Whitman, the original of "Eliza Wharton,"
and may have known her. Whatever the shortcomings
of her portrayal may be, it is clear that
the authoress was endeavoring to set forth in
her book the character, as she estimated it, of
the charming and gifted girl, the tragedy of whose
death is still unexplained. It is true that the
accuracy of the portrait in all respects may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
doubted. For example, the few letters of Elizabeth
Whitman that have been preserved are far
more spontaneous and delightful than any of Eliza
Wharton's epistles which constitute so large a
part of the story.</p>

<p>Evidently they are the letters of a different
person, as well as a more attractive one, than
Mrs. Foster's heroine. Then, too, Mrs. Foster's
tale has something of the effect of a tract, of
a moral effort. She is driving home an ethical
lesson and Eliza is the example to be shunned,
whereas modern speculation, grown more tolerant,
is apt to question the pre-judgment which
guided the novelist's pen. He who today seeks
to penetrate the old secret realizes that he is
furnished with only half of the evidence. On
that incomplete data how can a verdict of condemnation
be fairly based? Elizabeth's own
story has never been told.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here, for what it is worth, is
Mrs. Foster's notion, adapted to her fictional
purposes, of the kind of person the real Elizabeth
was, and from this reflection, faint and
clouded though it may be, of a genuine and
appealing character, the old novel today gathers
its greatest interest. For against the somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
somber background of her New England period
this Hartford girl stands forth with a flash of
brilliancy and charm. In the midst of a somewhat
limited and narrow social life, she was an
individualist, an exotic. In contrast with her
Puritan environment she seems almost Hellenic&mdash;yet
one fancies that there is something about
her more Gallic than Greek.</p>

<p>She was the eldest of the three daughters of
the Rev. Elnathan Whitman, D.D., a Fellow
of Yale College, and pastor from 1732 till his
death in 1777 of the Second Church in Hartford.
It is a singular coincidence that through her
mother, born Abigail Stanley, she traced kinship
to the Charlotte Stanley who was the
original of "Charlotte Temple." Her father was
a grandson of that noted divine, Solomon Stoddard
of Northampton, who, it will be remembered,
was the grandfather of Jonathan Edwards.
John Trumbull, the poet and judge, was a cousin
and so was Aaron Burr. Besides these, the
Pierreponts, the Whitneys, the Ogdens, the
Russells, the Wadsworths, were all kin or connected
by marriage.</p>

<p>Fairly early in life Elizabeth became engaged
to be married to the Rev. Joseph Howe, a Yale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
graduate, and for a while a tutor at the college,
whose chief pastorate was at the New South
Church in Boston. During the siege he was
compelled to flee from the city and, his health
failing, he died at Hartford, probably in 1776.</p>

<p>In that rare volume, "American Poems,
Selected and Original," published at Litchfield,
1793, is "An Ode, Addressed to Miss&mdash;. By
the late Rev. Joseph Howe, of Boston." Its
occasion was the departure, by sea, of the young
woman to whom it was addressed.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Nor less to heaven did I prefer,<br />
For thy dear sake, my pious prayer.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">O winds, O waves, agree!</span><br />
Winds gently blow, waves softly flow,<br />
Ship move with care, for thou dost bear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The better part of me."</span><br />
</div>

<p>It is possible, indeed probable, that Elizabeth
Whitman, who visited occasionally in Boston,
inspired these lines, but it appears that on her
part this love affair was of only moderate intensity
and that her father's death, which
occurred in the year following the death of her
betrothed, affected her far more than that of
the young minister she was to have married.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Not long after Mr. Whitman died, while Elizabeth
was visiting in New Haven at the home of
Dr. Ezra Stiles, President of Yale College, whose
daughter Betsy was her intimate friend, her
second love affair developed.</p>

<p>The Rev. Joseph Buckminster was also a
Yale graduate and tutor, later settling at
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in Dr. Stiles's
old parish, where his life was spent. He was
considered an exceptionally brilliant and promising
young man and he seems to have loved and
wooed Elizabeth ardently. It appears that she
had a deep affection for him, but also an intense
dread of the harrowing melancholia from which
he at times suffered. There is an intimation,
too, as to her own growing doubts of future
happiness in the somewhat limited rôle of a
New England minister's wife. Would her free
and eager spirit find satisfaction in a lifetime of
parochial routine? She was discussing her final
decision in this matter with her cousin Jeremiah
Wadsworth in the arbor of her mother's garden
when Buckminster, who did not like Colonel
Wadsworth, suddenly appeared and, misunderstanding
the situation, went away in great anger.</p>

<p>Are the following lines from a letter of Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to Joel Barlow, written at Hartford,
February 19, 1779, references to this affair?</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to find yourself quite out of Ambition's
way, and in the very bosom of content,&mdash;this certainly is
agreeable, and never more than when one has met with
trouble in a busier place. I felt myself no longer afraid
when a certain subject was started. I neither trembled nor
turned pale, but sat at my ease and felt as if nobody would
hurt me. I know you will laugh at me for a pusillanimous
creature for being ever so afraid as you have seen me; but
I cannot help it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"As to Mr. Baldwin, if he were at the door, I would
not run into the cupboard to avoid him. He may mean
well, in writing all to Buckminster and nothing to me; but
I do not think it."</p></div>

<p>After the encounter in the garden Elizabeth
wrote Buckminster explaining the matter, and,
we may infer, telling him that her decision
would have been unfavorable. His reply was
the announcement of his approaching marriage,
but in spite of this rapid <i>volte face</i> he is said to
have cherished Elizabeth's memory during all
of his life. Mrs. Dall in her "Romance of the
Association" tells the story of his burning the
first copy of "The Coquette" he read, which
he found on a parishioner's table. "It ought
never to have been written," he said, "and shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
never be read&mdash;at least, not in my parish. Bid
the ladies take notice, wherever I find a copy I
shall treat it in the same way."</p>

<p>Familiar letters are always a fairly clear
indication of character, and it is from these
letters of Elizabeth Whitman, printed in part
in her little book by Mrs. Dall, that we may
obtain our most direct knowledge of her personality.
After reading them one closes the book
with the conviction that here was a rare and
lovely woman. Here is wit, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'orginality'">originality</ins>, sympathy&mdash;one
is almost tempted to say a certain tenderness&mdash;encouragement,
good sense and good
advice. The writer obviously had that quality
that will forever be wholly captivating to the
masculine mind&mdash;the ability to enter whole-heartedly
into the aspirations and ambitions of
a friend, to make them her own, and to supply
the comforting assurance and admiration that
the male sex so frequently craves and that is so
often the spur to high endeavor. There is something
very winning about this affectionate
sympathy as displayed in these old letters, all,
with one exception, written to Joel Barlow at the
time when he was striving for accomplishment
and recognition as a poet. Yet the writer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
praise is not blind or overdone, for she does not
hesitate to criticise adversely, though in a most
engaging way, some of Barlow's verses that he
sends to her for her comment:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"There are so many beauties in your elegies, that it
looks like envy or ill-nature to pass them and dwell upon
the few faults; but you know that I do not leave them unnoticed
or unadmired. If you will have me find fault, I can
do it in a few instances with the expression. The sentiments
are everywhere beautiful, just and above all criticism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Why are you gloomy? You must not be. Expect
everything, hope everything, and do everything to make
your circumstances agreeable."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps Elizabeth did not feel incompetent
to assume the rôle of a critic and literary adviser,
for she herself had the true artist's desire for
self-expression and this found relief in her
own poetry which usually took the form of the
heroic couplet.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that the reader of these letters
should ask himself: Was there anything more
than friendship between Barlow and Elizabeth?
Doubtless the answer is in the negative. When
Elizabeth Whitman first met the poet he was
engaged to be married to Ruth Baldwin who
always remained one of Elizabeth's closest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
friends and who through all of Barlow's strange
career was his faithful and beloved wife. Yet
it is evident that in his correspondent Barlow's
wavering and self-centered spirit found a steadying
and assuring solace that he could never have
forgotten. Is it possible that he knew the secret
of the final mystery?</p>

<p>Of love affairs, other than those here indicated,
that may have transpired in Elizabeth's experience
before the catastrophe, we know little
or nothing. No doubt certain emotional adventures
occurred as the years passed. She was
exceptionally cultivated and entertaining and
all accounts agree that she was beautiful, though
her exact type of beauty is a matter of speculation,
for her portrait which for years after her
death hung in her old home was destroyed in
1831, when the house was burned&mdash;perhaps
with much memoranda which would have given
us a clue to her secret.</p>

<p>The following well-rounded sentence from
Mrs. Locke's historically inaccurate but emotionally
true preface to the edition of 1866 of
"The Coquette" is not without its character-illuminating
quality. "By her exceeding personal
beauty and accomplishments," wrote Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Locke of Elizabeth, of whose personality she
seems to have had some reliable evidence,
"added to the wealth of her mind, she attracted
to her sphere the grave and the gay, the learned
and the witty, the worshippers of the beautiful,
with those who reverently bend before all inner
graces."</p>

<p>For a young woman of the period her life was
reasonably varied and her acquaintance extensive.
At President Stiles's home, and elsewhere
in New Haven, where she often visited,
she met many men of distinction. She and
Betsy Stiles both spoke French fluently and it
is said that Elizabeth was greatly admired by
several of the French officers who had known Dr.
Stiles at Newport and who called upon him from
time to time at New Haven. Certain, it must be
confessed rather indefinite, "foreign secretaries"
are alleged to have fallen victims to her charms.</p>

<p>There is an intimation that after her father's
death she did not always find life at home
congenial. This is an inference&mdash;though not entirely
an inference&mdash;that one may readily accept.
There was an irony in the fate that placed this
vivid creature in a New England parsonage in
the last half of the eighteenth century. Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
or Florence in the days of the Renaissance&mdash;in
such a setting one can visualize her. But,
alas! there was little in common between the
New England of 1780 and the France or Italy
of three hundred years before.</p>

<p>And yet one thing was common&mdash;as it is
common wherever individuals of the human
race abide. When the great passion overwhelmed
her and swept her away from all that she
had known to a mysterious end, Elizabeth
Whitman was no longer a young girl. She was
a woman of experience, knowing the ways of
her world as well as any one of her day and time.
The love that broke down all restraints, that
surrendered everything, that threw the world
away, was no ordinary affair of the heart. It
was, in truth, the irresistible, the incredible,
the historic passion. It was of a piece with the
substance of which the great dramas of the world
are made and against the New England scene
it now became the motif of a tragedy.</p>

<p>On a day late in May, 1788, Elizabeth took
the stage at Hartford for Boston where she was
to visit her friend, Mrs. Henry Hill. No doubt
her family knew that something was wrong.
They knew, among other things, that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
spent all the preceding night alone in the starlight
on the roof of William Lawrence's house
on the north side of the old State House square.
It was a strange proceeding, but their daughter
and sister was, after all, a strange, temperamental
creature whose impulses and mental processes
they seldom understood and frequently disapproved.
Of how much more they were aware
we do not know&mdash;they must have had their suspicions&mdash;but
at least they were ignorant of her
purpose in her journey. From the moment when
she drove away in the stage neither they nor
any one of her Hartford friends saw her again&mdash;nor
did she reach her destination.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 29, 1788, the Salem "Mercury"
printed the following notice:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Last Friday, a female stranger died at the Bell Tavern,
in Danvers; and on Sunday her remains were decently
interred. The circumstances relative to this woman are
such as to excite curiosity, and interest our feelings. She
was brought to the Bell in a chaise, from Watertown, as
she said, by a young man whom she had engaged for that
purpose. After she had alighted, and taken a trunk with
her into the house, the chaise immediately drove off. She
remained at this inn till her death, in expectation of the
arrival of her husband, whom she expected to come for
her, and appeared anxious at his delay. She was averse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
being interrogated concerning herself or connections; and
kept much retired to her chamber, employed in needlework,
writing, etc. She said, however, that she came from
Westfield [Wethersfield?], in Connecticut; that her parents
lived in that state; that she had been married only a few
months; and that her husband's name was Thomas Walker,&mdash;but
always carefully concealed her family name.
Her linen was all marked E. W. About a fortnight
before her death, she was brought to bed of a lifeless child.
When those who attended her apprehended her fate, they
asked her, whether she did not wish to see her friends.
She answered, that she was very desirous of seeing them.
It was proposed that she should send for them; to which
she objected, hoping in a short time to be able to go to
them. From what she said, and from other circumstances,
it appeared probable to those who attended her, that she
belonged to some country town in Connecticut. Her conversation,
her writings, and her manners, bespoke the advantage
of a respectable family and good education. Her
person was agreeable; her deportment, amiable and engaging;
and, though in a state of anxiety, and suspense,
she preserved a cheerfulness which seemed to be not the
effect of insensibility, but of a firm and patient temper.
She was supposed to be about 35 years old. Copies of
letters, of her writing, dated at Hartford, Springfield, and
other places, were left among her things. This account is
given by the family in which she resided; and it is hoped
that the publication of it will be a means of ascertaining
her friends of her fate."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The hope of the editor of the "Mercury" was
realized. This notice, coming to the attention of
Mrs. Hill, finally resulted in the identification
of the mysterious lady of the Belt Tavern as
Elizabeth Whitman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i071.png" width="400" height="235" alt="Building with a monolith in front of it" />
<span class="caption">Monument and Bell Tavern, Danvers.</span>
</div>

<p>And that, really, is the whole story. The
succinct newspaper statement, with its contemporary
note and its effect of reality, furnishes
a more effective climax than the phrases of any
modern chronicler.</p>

<p>Yet one cannot quite close the record without
mention of a few incidents of the last days.</p>

<p>The copies of letters mentioned as found among
Elizabeth's belongings evidently escaped her, for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fearful of the outcome of her illness, she burned,
as she supposed, all her papers. A poem and part
of a letter, both clearly addressed to her lover or
husband, though no name was given, escaped her.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Must I die alone?" she wrote in those final days.
"Shall I never see you more? I know that you will come,
but you will come too late: This is, I fear, my last ability.
Tears fall so, I know not how to write. Why did you leave
me in so much distress? But I will not reproach you: All
that was dear I left for you: but do not regret it.&mdash;May
God forgive in both what was amiss:&mdash;When I go from
hence, I will leave you some way to find me:&mdash;if I die, will
you come and drop a tear over my grave?"</p></div>

<p>There is a legend, perhaps apocryphal, that
one afternoon she wrote in chalk on the inn door,
or on the flagging before it, her initials or other
sign, which a small boy rubbed out without her
knowledge. That evening, the legend runs, an
officer in uniform rode into the town on horseback
looking carefully at all the doors and walks,
but speaking to no one. Not finding what he
evidently sought, he is said to have ridden despondently
away.</p>

<p>During all her stay at Danvers, Elizabeth
wore a wedding ring and at her request it was
buried with her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the identity of the man whom Elizabeth
loved there have been many speculations. A
cousin of hers, an able man, distinguished in
the history of his time, has often been assumed
to have been the cause of her tragedy, but it is
fair to his memory to say that he denied this
assumption vehemently. The late Charles
Hoadly, State Librarian of Connecticut, had a
theory that the man was a prominent member
of the Yale class of 1776, but no evidence for
this belief is given. Another supposition is that
Elizabeth, against the wishes of her family, had
contracted a marriage with a French Romanist
who, had he acknowledged this union, would
have forfeited his inheritance. Probably Jeremiah
Wadsworth, who was her friend and adviser,
knew the secret, but if so it perished with
him.</p>

<p>Her brother William, who was eight years
younger than she, long survived her, dying in
Hartford on Christmas Day, 1846, at the age
of eighty-six. In the old man, who was one of
the last in his city to wear the knee breeches of
the preceding century, it would have been
difficult to recognize Elizabeth's "little rogue
of a brother" whom she frequently commended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to Joel Barlow's care while at Yale. Through
a slight knowledge of medicine he acquired the
title of "Doctor," but he was also admitted to
the bar and for some time was Town Clerk, and
Clerk of the City Court. In his later years he
became something of an antiquary and after
the Wadsworth Atheneum was built he found
in that castellated home of the humanities,
particularly in the library, a grateful refuge from
the world, where he was always ready to converse
with other visitors upon incidents of days
long gone by. One subject, however, was universally
accepted as unapproachable. With his
son, who died unmarried in Philadelphia in
1875, the line of the Rev. Elnathan Whitman
became extinct.</p>

<p>After Elizabeth's death her brother is not
known to have mentioned her name outside of
the family, but for many years he made an
annual pilgrimage to her grave with his sister
Abigail. The letter of an old resident tells us
that after Elizabeth died the door of her room
in the Whitman home was kept locked and
nothing disturbed till fire destroyed the building.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a><br /><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>




<h2>III: The Hemans of America</h2>


<div class='cap'>IN 1866, the year after her death, Timothy
Dwight, later beloved president of Yale
University, contributed to "The New <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Englandler'">Englander</ins>"
an article on Mrs. Sigourney in the form of a
review of her posthumous autobiography, entitled
"Letters of Life." This article deserves
to be remembered because, for one thing, it
reflects from its author's mind a sense of humor
which Mrs. Sigourney never, even in her most
inspired moments, displayed.</div>

<p>We all recall the old story of the Hartford
personage who achieved a certain measure of
fame by remarking that Mrs. Sigourney's personal
obituary poems had added a new terror
to death. Dr. Dwight's paper begins with a
reference to this same phase of the poetess.</p>

<p>"Whenever any person has died in our
country," he says, "during the last score of
years, who was of public reputation sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
justify it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a kind of calm and peaceful
confidence has rested in our minds, that, within a
brief season, a poetical obituary would appear in
the public prints from the well-known pen of Mrs.
Sigourney. Indeed so general has been this confidence
among the people of Connecticut, that
some persons, who, from peculiar modesty or
from some other reason, have desired to escape
the notice of the great world after death, have
been beset by a kind of perpetual fear that she
might survive them, and thus, having them at
a great disadvantage, might send out their
names unto all the earth."</p>

<p>And later on in the essay he mentions the
reported story of the man who was unwilling
to travel from New Haven to Hartford on the
same train with the distinguished Hartford
lady lest in case of a railroad accident she might
put him into rhyme.</p>

<p>Though it is doubtful if the author of "The
Anthology of Spoon River" ever heard of these
obituary poems, they form a strange precedent
for that original collection of verse. Some of them
were gathered by their authoress in a volume entitled
"The Man of Uz, and Other Poems," published
at Hartford in 1862, where the literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
antiquarian may still peruse them. If they originally
possessed any poetry it is now extinct, and
the only interest remaining is the personal one.
To those for whom the older Hartford still has its
appeal such names as those of Colonel Samuel
Colt, Samuel Tudor, "The Brothers Buell,"
Harvey Seymour, D. F. Robinson, Judge Thomas
S. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Willaims'">Williams</ins>, Deacon Normand Smith, Governor
Joseph Trumbull, and Mary Shipman Deming&mdash;to
mention only a few&mdash;have their memories
and possibly their family associations.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not strange that such a considerable
part of Mrs. Sigourney's facile effusions
related to the tomb for hers was the age of
pensive sentiment. It was the time when the
weeping willow was popular in all forms of art,
from the tombstone to the mezzotint illustration,
when young ladies sang captivatingly, to the
harp, of an early death, when funeral sermons
were printed, widely circulated and even read,
and when everybody was wondering whether
they were numbered among the "elect" or&mdash;not.</p>

<p>Yet it would be a mistake to give the impression
that all the sentiment of the time, or all of
Mrs. Sigourney's poetry, partook of gloom. Far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from it. Though there was, to be sure, a kind
of background of agreeable melancholy, and
such alluring titles of her books as "Whisper to
a Bride" and "Water Drops" (a plea for temperance)
were doubtless not intentionally humorous,
Mrs. Sigourney could be playful at times
and she invariably painted the immediate scene
in colors of the rose. She was, in fact, an idealist.
She so far idealized her early surroundings in
Norwich, where she was born, that Dr. Dwight,
who also knew Norwich in his boyhood, finds
difficulty in identifying places and people. She
even idealized the Park River, sometimes known
in her day, as in ours, by a less euphonious title,
alluding to it as "the fair river that girdled the
domain [her home on what is now known as
Asylum Hill] from which it was protected by a
mural parapet." Who other than Mrs. Sigourney
could have transformed an ordinary stone
wall into a "mural parapet"?</p>

<span class="caption">THE SIGOURNEY MANSION</span>
</div>

<p>Speaking of the Park River, Mrs. Sigourney,
in the course of describing the pastoral surroundings
of what was then her country home,
confesses that she could never understand why
pigs were unmentionable in polite society&mdash;though
we think she herself refrained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a><br /><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
referring to them by their ordinary term. "Such
treatment," she asserts "is peculiarly ungrateful
in a people who allow this scorned creature
to furnish a large part of their subsistence, to
swell the gains of commerce and to share with
the monarch of ocean the honor of lighting the
evening lamp."</p>

<p>Here are two other references, quoted by Dr.
Dwight, to this rural "domain" of which the
dwelling house, it will be remembered, is still
standing:</p>

<p>"Two fair cows, with coats brushed to a
satin sleekness, ruminated at will, and filled
large pails with creamy nectar."</p>

<p>And again, the poultry "munificently gave
us their eggs, their offspring and themselves."</p>

<p>But even this idealized Sabine farm was not
exempt from the troubles that lie in wait for all
of us, and we must be chivalrous enough to
admit that Mrs. Sigourney bore the sorrows that
came to her with grace and dignity. Soon after
the poetess and her husband took up their residence
here Mr. Sigourney was overtaken by
business troubles, which his wife translates
into "obstructions in the course of mercantile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>prosperity," and she cheerfully undertook various<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">economies, among which was "prolonging</span><br />
the existence of garments by transmigration."
Later the family moved to a less pretentious
home on High street where the latter part of the
life of Mrs. Sigourney, who survived her husband,
was spent.</p>

<p>Later still this house became a kind of shrine,
and a distinguished Yale teacher and poet, whose
people, back in his undergraduate days of the
sixties, dwelt for a time in the poetess's old home,
has told the writer how nice old ladies from the
country used to make pilgrimages thither to
pluck a spray of lilac from the garden where the
poetess was wont to walk and to see the room
where she "mused."</p>

<p>The fact is that she appears to have dwelt in
a world of the mind that, however real to her,
was in reality distinctly artificial, like most of
her poetic writings. In these faded verses there
now appears to be little real thought, still less
real poetry. The only stanzas about which any
flavor of poetic eloquence still clings are those
entitled "The Return of Napoleon from St.
Helena" and "Indian Names." Compare her
"Niagara" and "The Indian Summer" with the
poems on the same subjects by J. G. C. Brainard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
another now almost forgotten Hartford
poet of her time, whose early death prevented
the flowering of a fame that was just beginning
to unfold, and the reader grasps at once the
difference between a certain graceful turn of
thought and facility of phrase on the one hand,
and genuine poetic genius on the other.</p>

<span class='small'>FROM A MINIATURE IN THE COLT COLLECTION</span><br />

<span class='small'>BY PERMISSION OF THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM</span></span>
</div>

<p>And yet in her day she had a prodigious
vogue and the reference to her as "The Hemans
of America," while now holding a certain facetious
implication, was gravely accepted at the
time. Her journey abroad after her husband's
death was in its way a sort of mild ovation. She
met Queen Victoria and it is significant as well
as amusing to find that our Hartford citizeness
alluded to the Queen as "a sister woman." Her
verses were translated into several languages
and she received presents and letters of commendation
from the King of Prussia, the Empress
of Russia and the Queen of France.</p>

<p>The explanation of her contemporary popularity
must lie in the state of mind of the period.
In that era "sensibility" was the passport to
literary success and Mrs. Sigourney certainly
possessed sensibility, if nothing else, to a high
degree. Those sentimental, yearly gift books
known as "annuals" were a phenomenon of the
time, and no "annual" was complete without one
or more of her poems. It is time that some qualified
person gave to the world a study of this old
"annual" literature, so sentimental, so romantic,
and so generally languishing. The most
delightful appreciation that comes to mind at
the moment, of the "annual" as a literary curio
is contained in Professor Beers's life of Willis
in the American Men of Letters series&mdash;or in his
essay on Percival in "The Ways of Yale."</p>

<p>There is a certain pathos in the fact that the
years have denied this Hartford poetess's gentle
claim to immortality, because the impossibility
of granting this claim has led the world to neglect
two very definite and admirable characteristics
she possessed.</p>

<p>One is that she was a remarkably good woman.
She carried her Christian precepts into her daily
practice in a way that few of us seem to succeed
in doing. In spite of a little harmless vanity,
everyone who came in contact with her appears
to have admired and loved her.</p>

<p>In the social life of the old city she was a
leading and popular figure. Samuel G. Goodrich
in his "Recollections of a Life Time" describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Hartford in the second decade of the nineteenth
century says of Mrs. Sigourney, then Miss Huntley:
"Noiselessly and gracefully she glided into
our social circle and ere long was its presiding
genius.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mingling in the gayeties of our
social gatherings and in no respect clouding their
festivity, she led us all toward intellectual pursuits
and amusements. We had even a literary
cotery under her inspiration, its first meetings being
held at Mr. Wadsworth's." Before the writer
lie a half dozen of Mrs. Sigourney's letters written
in her distinct and regular handwriting. They
relate to business matters, to social engagements,
and a few are letters of consolation. Perhaps
they seem a little stilted and formal, but in all
the personal notes there is evident a very genuine
and very charming spirit of sympathy and kindliness.</p>

<p>The other trait that has been largely forgotten
is that she was a natural teacher of youth. In
her early days in Hartford she conducted a school
for girls on singularly successful and somewhat
original lines. This she relinquished on her
marriage, but for nearly half a century those of
her old pupils who lived never failed to meet
annually with her in remembrance of their early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
association. Clearly, she inspired in them all an
ardent and lasting affection.</p>

<p>On the writer's desk, among her letters, lies
an ancient school copy-book containing the
transcript of an address she made to her old
scholars August 17, 1822, "on their meeting to
form a Charitable and Literary Society." It is
characteristic that the greater part of this composition
is concerned with affectionate and what
now seem rather pathetic sketches of the five
young girls of her flock who had died. The
address confirms what we know from other
sources&mdash;that her school was started in 1814,
soon after she came from Norwich to Hartford.</p>

<p>The old manuscript abounds in unimpeachable
moral aphorisms. One may, perhaps,
smile at the carefully balanced phraseology of
this: "Some sciences are more attractive to
ambition, more congenial with fame, more omnipotent
over wealth, but I know of none so closely
connected with happiness as the science of doing
good." Yet most of us would be better men and
women if we applied that maxim in our lives as
constantly as did this gentle "lady of old
years." In her teaching "the science of doing
good" was not a theoretical matter alone. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was directed to practical ends. "During a period
of somewhat less than two years and a half,"
she says, "you completed for the poor 160 garments
of different descriptions, many of which
were carefully altered and repaired from your
own&mdash;among them 35 pairs of stockings, knit
without sacrifice of time during the afternoon
reading and recitation of history. You likewise
contributed ten dollars to the Asylum for the
Deaf and Dumb, five dollars to the schools then
established among the Cherokees, and distributed
religious books to an amount exceeding
ten dollars, among the children of poverty and
ignorance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some of you were accustomed
to gain time for these extra employments
by rising an hour earlier in the morning."</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Sigourney continued her school it
is not by any means preposterous to believe that
her fame as an educator might have outlasted
her reputation in literature, and that she might
have shared with Miss Beecher of the old Hartford
Female Seminary a certain degree of distinction
in connection with the early education
of women in this country.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV: Whom the Gods Love</h2>


<div class='cap'>IN the year 1822 there drifted into the friendly
social life of the old town a short, odd looking
young man who, it developed, had come to take
editorial charge of "The Connecticut Mirror,"
a weekly newspaper, strongly federal in politics,
which had been established in 1809 by Charles
Hosmer and which, at this time, had just been
bought by Messrs. Goodsell and Wells, whose
place of business was at the corner of Main and
Asylum streets.</div>

<p>The name of this young man was John Gardiner
Calkins Brainard and he was twenty-six
years old. Those who inquired about him learned
that he was a native of New London and the son
of Judge Jeremiah G. Brainard of the Superior
Court. In 1815 he had been graduated at Yale&mdash;a
classmate of that strange genius James
Gates Percival, poet, physician, geologist. After
studying law in his brother's office he had practiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
for a time in Middletown, but it was rumored
that his tastes were literary rather than
legal, and that the law had not proved very
successful.</p>

<p>In spite of his rather uncouth appearance this
newcomer soon became a favorite among the
young people. He was clever&mdash;any one could see
that. His frequent witty and amusing sayings
gathered an arresting emphasis from their contrast
with intervals of quietness and even of
apparent depression. Perhaps this hint of an underlying
seriousness had its especial charm for
the young ladies. Remember that in those days
Byron was in fashion. But there was something
about this young man that attracted also friends
of his own sex. "The first time I ever saw him,"
says a writer in the "Boston Statesman,"
quoted by Whittier in his memoir of Brainard, "I
met him in a gay and fashionable circle. He was
pointed out to me as the poet Brainard&mdash;a plain,
ordinary looking individual, careless in his dress,
and apparently without the least claim to the
attention of those who value such advantages(?).
But there was no person there so much or so
flatteringly attended to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was evidently
the idol, not only of the poetry-loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and gentler sex&mdash;but also of the young men who
were about him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>We can picture young Mr. Brainard as one of
the leading figures in that "literary cotery,"
which Goodrich describes and which was presided
over by Mrs. Sigourney. It was in a room
adjoining Goodrich's at Ripley's Tavern that
Brainard soon took up his abode and the two
became fast friends.</p>

<p>The discovery was soon made that young Mr.
Brainard was by way of being a poet&mdash;if,
indeed, the fact was not already known. Verses,
obviously from his pen, appeared constantly in
his newspaper. Indeed some of the paper's
readers may have recognized the new editor's
hand through their familiarity with the verse he
had sometimes written for the "Mirror" before
his official connection with that journal. His first
contribution to the paper in his new capacity
appeared in the issue for February 25, 1822, in
which the change of ownership and the new
editor were announced. This contribution was in
the form of a poem "On the Birthday of Washington."&mdash;"Behold
the moss'd cornerstone dropp'd
from the wall," ran the first line. It was not
a great poem, but it sounded a sincere, patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
note, had a genuine poetic touch and far excelled
most newspaper verse of the day.</p>

<p>And so this original young man, with his light
brown hair, rather pale face, large eyes and
obvious "temperament" began to acquire the
character and reputation of a poet. We fancy
that this reputation was somewhat limited until
on a sudden impulse he wrote "The Fall of Niagara."
This piece of blank verse, though now
largely forgotten in the lapse of years, had in its
time a tremendous vogue. It was copied far and
wide, took its place in school readers and for
years was declaimed by youthful orators before
committees and admiring parents at school exhibitions.</p>

<p>We do not know the exact date of its composition,
but it must have been before 1825, for it
appeared in the author's first collection of verse
published in that year. It was written one raw
March evening in an emergency, to make copy
for the next morning's paper. Goodrich tells
the story. Brainard was half ill with a cold and
Goodrich went over with him to the "Mirror"
office and started a fire in the Franklin stove,
while his companion, miserable and depressed,
talked at random, abhorring the compulsion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
made writing a necessity and his procrastination
that had postponed his work, till the last moment.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Some time passed," says Goodrich, "in similar talk,
when at last Brainard turned suddenly, took up his pen
and began to write. I sat apart and left him to his work.
Some twenty minutes passed, when, with a radiant smile
on his face, he got up, approached the fire, and, taking the
candle to light his paper, he read as follows:</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE FALL OF NIAGARA.</div>

<div class='poem'>
'The thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain,<br />
While I look upward to thee. It would seem<br />
As if God pour'd thee from his 'hollow hand.'<br />
And hung his bow upon thy awful front;<br />
And spoke in that loud voice, which seem'd to him<br />
Who dwelt in Patmos for his Saviour's sake,<br />
'The sound of many waters'; and had bade<br />
Thy flood to chronicle the ages back.<br />
And notch his cent'ries in the eternal rocks.'<br />
</div>

<p>"He had hardly done reading when the [printer's] boy
came. Brainard handed him the lines&mdash;on a small scrap
of rather coarse paper&mdash;and told him to come again in half
an hour. Before this time had elapsed, he had finished,
read me the following stanza:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Deep calleth unto deep. And what are we,<br />
That hear the question of that voice sublime?<br />
Oh, what are all the notes that ever rung<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>From war's vain trumpet by thy thundering side?<br />
Yea, what is all the riot man can make,<br />
In his short life, to thy unceasing roar?<br />
And yet, bold babbler, what art thou to Him<br />
Who drown'd a world, and heap'd the waters far<br />
Above its loftiest mountains?&mdash;a light wave,<br />
That breathes and whispers of its Maker's might.'<br />
</div>

<p>"These lines having been furnished, Brainard left his
office and we returned to Miss Lucy's parlor. He seemed
utterly unconscious of what he had done.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
lines went forth and produced a sensation of delight over
the whole country."</p></div>

<p>It is not too much to say that Niagara brought
Brainard fame. To the modern ear inured to free
verse its lines may sound perhaps a trifle over
sonorous and formal. But it has real poetic
eloquence and inspiration. Brainard had never
been within less than five hundred miles of the
great falls.</p>

<p>The Niagara is the first poem in that collection
of the poet's verses published in 1825,
alluded to above. Before the writer at the
moment lies a copy of this rather rare volume.
Goodrich arranged for its publication with Bliss
and White of New York and with difficulty persuaded
Brainard to do the necessary work of collection
and revision. It was the only collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of his verses that was published during the poet's
life. Two others were issued after his death&mdash;one
in 1832, with a memoir by Whittier, and
one, with a prefatory sketch by the Rev. Dr.
Robbins, in 1842. The copy of the first collection,
now on the writer's desk, bears on the fly-leaf
this inscription in the author's handwriting:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i100.png" width="450" height="249" alt="Handwritten: Will you allow this a place in your Library and oblige Yours very respectfully JGCBrainard To/D Wadsworth Esq" />
</div>

<p>The thin little book has the title, "Occasional
Pieces of Poetry," which is peculiarly appropriate,
for most of Brainard's poems were suggested
by incidents of daily life that came to his
attention. For example, the stage coach from
Hartford to New Haven falls through a bridge
and two lives are lost&mdash;the occurrence prompts
him to write the "Lines on a Melancholy Accident;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the visit of Lafayette to this country in
1824 occasions some verses to "the only surviving
general of the Revolution;" the death
of two persons who were struck by lightning during
a religious service in Montville suggests
"The Thunder Storm;" the humorous verses
entitled "The Captain" result from the genuinely
amusing situation that arose in New
London harbor when the wreck of the Norwich
Methodist meeting house, that had come down
the river in a freshet, collided with an anchored
schooner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i102.png" width="339" height="600" alt="Title page of: OCCASIONAL PIECES OF POETRY. BY JOHN G. C. BRAINARD." />
</div>

<p>The fact that the poet took many every-day
affairs as the immediate occasion for his versifying
accounts for the trivial character of some
of his work. On the other hand it illustrates the
theory he held of the need of a genuine American
literature. Though he read eagerly Byron and
Scott, he deprecated in the columns of the "Mirror"
the imitation of foreign writers by American
men of letters, holding that our own history,
traditions and environment gave inspiration
enough.</p>

<p>He welcomed the appearance of Cooper with
enthusiasm, and a story which ran in the "Mirror"
under the title of "Letters from Fort
Braddock" and which was largely in the Cooper
manner was written by him though published
anonymously. Indeed a great part of his work
dealt with local matters. "Matchit Moodus" expresses
a fantastic legend of the "Moodus noises."
"The Black Fox of Salmon River" embodies in
verse another grim local tradition. "The Shad
Spirit" and "Lines to the Connecticut River" are
other similar examples of his use of the folk-lore
of the Connecticut valley.</p>

<p>Professor Beers of Yale cites the exquisite
little lyric beginning "The dead leaves strew the
forest walk," as about the best example of his
work. Goodrich says it was written after the
departure from Hartford of a young lady from
Savannah to whom the poet had been devoted
during her visit. Very attractive, too, are the
lines on "Indian Summer." The blank verse
entitled "The Invalid on the East End of Long
Island," has a melancholy note but deserves
remembrance. It was there that Brainard spent
the few weeks just before the end.</p>

<p>He was too sensitive and unaggressive a soul
both for the law and for the political wrangling
which attended the newspaper controversies of
the day. In the practical life of his country and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his time, which had small place for artistic
aspiration or expression, he was an anomaly
simply because he was a real poet. To this
situation may be attributed no doubt in large
measure the sense of failure, unquestionably
exaggerated, which he often expressed. "Don't
expect too much of me," he said to Goodrich at
their first meeting, "I never succeeded in anything
yet. I could never draw a mug of cider
without spilling more than half of it."</p>

<p>His frequent depression, however, was not all
temperament&mdash;it had a physical basis. In the
spring of 1827 incipient tuberculosis compelled
him to give up his work on the "Mirror," and on
September 26, 1828, a month before his thirty-second
birthday, he died at his home in New
London.</p>

<p>His death called forth the customary poetic
obituary from his friend Mrs. Sigourney&mdash;one of
the best she ever wrote&mdash;voicing a sincere and
generous appreciation. Whittier, with other
poets of the day, added his word of memory and
praise. Perhaps a line from Snelling best expresses
in a few words the whole story&mdash;</p>

<h2>V: An Eccentric Visitor</h2>


<div class='cap'>WE may be permitted to take a certain
pride in the fact that most strangers who
sojourn for a time among us express admiration
and liking for the town. There has been, however,
one historic and notable exception. A young man
named Percival who visited us in 1815, the year
of his graduation from Yale College, did not care
for Hartford at all and, moreover, did not hesitate
to proclaim his distaste in some of the verses
he was then engaged in writing. However, poor
Percival did not like any spot very well. It is
with a sense of faint amusement or, when we
know his history, of compassion, rather than
with any shade of resentment, that we now read
the stanzas in which he published his sentiments
to an unappreciative world:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Ismir! Fare thee well forever!<br />
From thy walls with joy I go,<br />
Every tie I freely sever,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Flying from thy den of woe.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">*&nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; &nbsp;  *</span><br />
<br />
Ismir! Land of cursed deceivers,<br />
Where the sons of darkness dwell<br />
Hope, the cherub's base bereavers,&mdash;<br />
Hateful city! Fare thee well."<br />
</div>

<p>When he wrote this James Gates Percival was
twenty years old. Some of the emotion of these
lines arose simply from uncurbed youthful reaction
from disappointment. Most of it, however,
was individual and characteristic temperament&mdash;the
same uncomfortable mental constitution that
seemed to make it impossible for him to withhold
the vitriolic verses he wrote and printed on
the character of a clergyman who had objected
to Percival's suit for his daughter's hand.</p>

<p>The young poet had come to Hartford on the
invitation of his classmate, Horace Hooker, who
later entered the ministry and whose wife wrote
for the young a number of very instructive and
very pious stories which in their day attained a
considerable popularity. It was hoped that in the
literary atmosphere which at that time existed
in Hartford this odd young man, with his undoubted
poetic strain and his dreamy and contemplative
nature, would find a congenial milieu.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The visit, however, was a failure. Young
Percival was not popular. "He was too shy and
modest," says his biographer, "to adapt himself
to different circles. He wanted confidence,
and at social gatherings [in Hartford] he talked
at great length on single subjects, but in so low
a tone that people could not hear him. He was
not treated as he expected to be; it seemed to him
that he was not appreciated, and he came away
in disgust."</p>

<p>This charge against us of lack of appreciation
finds some mitigation in the fact that the poet
departed from many places in the same frame
of mind and for the same reason. Percival was
one of those pathetic spirits who find the world
an unhappy abiding place. His constitutional
wretchedness was in fact so extreme that he is
said in early life to have attempted self-destruction
and one of his best poems, as well as one of
the gloomiest in the language, reflects his moods
at this period under the title of "The Suicide."</p>

<p>Fortune aggravated the disadvantage of one
unfitted at the best to cope with the world by
allotting to him a life of penury. For many years
he lived as a recluse in the State Hospital Building
in New Haven where he was allowed the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of three rooms which he never permitted visitors
to enter&mdash;on one occasion even refusing to admit
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It is related
that at another time a somewhat pompous
gentleman, accompanied by two ladies, was
visiting the building and, learning that the poet
lived there, rapped at his door and then stood
waiting, a lady on each side of him. The door
opened a crack and Percival's face appeared.
"I am extremely happy and rejoiced," began
the visitor, with a great deal of manner, "that I
have the honor of addressing the poet Percival&mdash;"
But he got no further, for Percival instantly
ejaculated "Boo!" and slammed the
door. This seems to have been his customary
manner of excusing himself to callers.</p>

<p>Percival's lack of means was in a way his own
fault&mdash;or at least it was the result of his peculiar
disposition which, in its sensitiveness to purely
imaginary slights and its impossibility of concession
or adaptation, worked constantly against
his prosperity. His friends were faithful and
long-suffering and often came to the rescue. In
spite of his oddities there seems to have been a
singular charm about the man like the charm of
an unexpectedly original child. When the bane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of an intense bashfulness was removed and he
was alone with one or two intimates, his talk is
said to have been delightful. He became absolutely
absorbed in any topic in which he was interested
and brought to bear upon it a wealth
of allusion and comment of which few minds
were capable.</p>

<p>As a poet he is now forgotten, yet it is a suggestive
and significant fact that in 1828, when
a project was in hand to publish a group picture
of nine living American poets, Percival was to
occupy the center of the stage, while such minor
lights as Bryant, Irving and Halleck, with others,
were to surround him.</p>

<p>But the fame he longed for and, with an almost
childlike naïveté, claimed as his due, was short-lived.
It barely touched him and passed him by.
Yet he deserves remembrance, if only for his
versatility. While it is chiefly as a poet that
mention is made of him in encyclopedias and
other books of reference, he was capable, but for
his temperamental disabilities, of shining in
many lines and in one pursuit other than poetry
he has left a lasting memorial. He studied law,
was admitted to the bar and never practiced.
He served his medical apprenticeship under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
good friend Dr. Eli Ives of New Haven, took his
degree, practiced a little and, though he was
always afterward known as "Doctor," abandoned
the profession&mdash;except that later in life
he was post surgeon at Boston till his abhorrence
of examining recruits compelled him to
relinquish the work. At one time he thought of
entering the ministry and he was always an
authority on theology and dogma. He gave up
his appointment as a professor of chemistry at
the Military Academy at West Point because in
going to his quarters he had to use the same hallway
with other officers. He was a learned botanist
and a linguist of rare attainments. In 1827
he carried through successfully the immense task
of correcting the proofs and supervising the publication
of Webster's unabridged dictionary&mdash;and
seems to have been happier in this work of
enormous detail than at any other time of his life.</p>

<p>But it was as a geologist that his most valuable
practical work was done. His "Report on
the Geology of Connecticut," published in 1842,
was the result of five years of arduous labor and
is a sufficient monument for any man.</p>

<p>"While engaged in this survey," he wrote,
"I can confidently say that I have been laborious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and diligent. While traveling, it was my
practice to rise early, in the longer days generally
at dawn; in the shorter generally I got my
breakfast and was on my way by daybreak, I
continued, scarcely with any relaxation, as long
as I had daylight and then was generally obliged
to sit up till midnight, not unfrequently till one
o'clock <span class="small">A. M.</span> in order to complete my notes and
arrange my specimens. This was continued, not
only week after week, but month after month,
almost without cessation."</p>

<p>Under the law Percival could not be paid till
his report had been approved by the governor.
It is characteristic of the whimsical geologist
that he refused to submit to this approval by
one whom he considered incompetent to pass
upon his labors and it was only by the ruse of a
friend who got possession of the report and presented
it to the governor, who at once approved
it, that Percival secured his pay.</p>

<p>This work brought Percival a high reputation
as a geologist. He was engaged by the American
Mining Company to investigate the lead deposits
in Wisconsin and this in turn resulted in
his employment by that state to make a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'geolological'">geological</ins>
survey similar to that of Connecticut. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had made his first report and was engaged upon
his second when he became ill and in May, 1856,
he died and was buried in Hazel Green, Wisconsin.
"Eminent as a Poet," runs his epitaph,
"rarely accomplished as a Linguist, learned and
acute in Science, a Man without Guile."</p>

<p>During his employment in Wisconsin his
friends had bought a lot and built a house for
him in New Haven. It was a queer structure,
built after the poet's own plans, with the entrance
at the rear, blind windows at the front,
and of only one story in height. He was looking
forward to spending here his last years, close to
his college, with his few intimate friends, surrounded
by his books. During an interval in his
Wisconsin employment he came to New Haven
to inspect his future home and is said to have
broken down completely as he was compelled to
leave by the duty that called him westward.</p>

<p>He was a strange creature, impossible to get
along with, handicapped by an over-sensitiveness
that led him into resentments that often
held the implication of ingratitude, and with a
constant grudge against the world. He should
have been endowed and relieved of all the detail
of life. Even then it is doubtful if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
would have produced great poetry, unless he had
been rigorously trained by some dominant
master to condense, revise and work over again
and again his diffuse, sentimental and dreamy
verses. A few of them retained for a time a certain
vogue and then gradually passed into oblivion.
Perhaps the two that were longest remembered
were "To Seneca Lake" and "The Coral
Grove." It is an odd thing, but some selections
from a boyish effort entitled "Seasons of New
England," hitherto generally cited as evidence
of his youthful absurdities, would make excellent
examples of the free verse that nowadays is
taken so seriously. In this respect, at least, he
was ahead of his time.</p>

<p>In his review of the "Life and Letters"
Lowell seems rather dogmatic and intolerant,
but with his inevitable insight and art of statement
he crystalizes into one sentence the whole
trouble with Percival. "He appears," writes
Lowell, "as striking an example as could be
found of the poetic temperament unballasted
with those less obvious qualities which make the
poetic faculty."</p>

<p>It should be recorded that children loved this
old bachelor in spite of his eccentricities and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with them he seemed to feel unrestrained and
free, forgetting the shyness that formed an insuperable
barrier to ready friendship with adults.
In our Connecticut history he should not be
forgotten and if any of the spirits of the departed
revisit the glimpses of the moon this strange
apparition ought sometimes to be met, driving
his phantom buggy through forgotten lanes of
the state he loved, or with his hammer and bag
of specimens, climbing on foot the hills and ledges
he knew so well.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a><br /><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a><br /><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI: Who Was Peter Parley?</h2>


<div class='cap'>IF your great-grandmother were living, dear
reader, she would be appalled at your ignorance
in propounding this question. Everybody
knew the identity of "Peter Parley." In his
day his name was as familiar a <i>nom de plume</i> as
Mark Twain. He was, of course, Samuel G.
Goodrich. And who&mdash;alas for the question!&mdash;was
Samuel G. Goodrich?</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Ah, pensive scholar, what is fame?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A fitful tongue of leaping flame;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A giddy whirlwind's fickle gust,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That lifts a pinch of mortal dust;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A few swift years, and who can show</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which dust was Bill, and which was Joe?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>He does not deserve to be forgotten. Born
at Ridgefield, Connecticut, in 1793, he died at
New York City in 1860. For twenty-four hours
his body lay in state in St. Bartholomew's Church
where crowds passed his bier and at Southbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Connecticut, where he was buried, groups of
children preceded the coffin and strewed flowers
in its path.</p>

<p>It was a fitting and touching ceremony, for
all his life he had been the friend of children. It
was almost entirely for them that he wrote his
two hundred books, of which he estimated, five
years before his death, that seven million copies
had then been sold, including, we assume, those
editions that had been translated into nearly
every modern language, even Greek and Persian.</p>

<p>Rummage among the top shelves of any old
library and you will be pretty sure to discover
some of these almost forgotten volumes&mdash;Parley's
"Tales of the Sea," "Tales About the Sun,
Moon and Stars," tales about New York, about
ancient Rome, about Great Britain, about
animals, about almost everything in this interesting
world and outside of it. Of his "Natural
History" George Du Maurier says&mdash;"Last, but
not least of our library, was Peter Parley's
'Natural History,' of which we knew every word
by heart," and a writer in the "Congregationalist"
a quarter of a century ago ventured the
opinion, "We have no doubt, were it needed,
that 1,000 aged people could rise and repeat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
widely famous lines, 'The world is round and,
like a ball, seems swinging in the air.'"</p>

<p>You will find as a frontispiece for some of these
well worn books a picture of a kindly old gentleman
in a cocked hat, with a crutch and a gouty
foot, his pockets bulging with good things for
children. This was the mythical "Peter Parley",
and Goodrich tells an amusing story of how,
during a visit in the South, his host's little grandson,
after cautiously inspecting the visitor who
had been introduced to him as Peter Parley, took
his grandfather aside and warned him that the
guest must be an impostor, for his foot wasn't
bound up and he didn't walk with a crutch.</p>

<p>Perhaps in your search on the dusty shelves
you will be fortunate enough to find a copy of
Goodrich's verses entitled "The Outcast, and
Other Poems," printed in 1841, or an odd number
of "The Token," an "annual," which
Goodrich published from 1828 till 1842 and in
which were first given to the world some of the
early productions of such young literary sparks
as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes
and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</p>

<p>During the course of an eventful life Goodrich
came into relations more or less intimate with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
many famous people. A few of them, beside
those just mentioned, were Daniel Webster (who
had a great admiration for his writings), James
Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving, Whittier,
Jeffery, founder and editor of the Edinburgh
Review, Sir Walter Scott and Lockhart his son-in-law
and biographer. Goodrich was an eye-witness
in Paris of the Revolution of '48 and he
draws a vivid portrait of the third Napoleon on
the eve of the Coup d'Etat. His daughter tells
of an informal celebration in Florence, planned
in his honor by Charles Lever, at which there
were present the Brownings, the Tennysons, (she
liked Frederic the best) the Storys, Gibson
and Powers the sculptors, Lowell, Lamartine,
Longfellow, Trollope, Buchanan Read and others&mdash;surely
a brilliant company of which to be the
center.</p>

<p>In London he was present at the ceremonies
attendant upon the return of Byron's body from
Greece. He heard Clay, Calhoun, John Randolph
and other celebrities of the day speak in
the Senate. He was a guest at levees at the
White House and gives a dramatic account of a
meeting there between Jackson and John Quincy
Adams on the night of the former's defeat for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the presidency by the latter. He saw John Marshall
presiding over the Supreme Court. He
presents a minute description of President
Monroe whom he encountered both at Washington
and also at Hartford during a ceremony at
the School for the Deaf, and whose personal
appearance he thought far from prepossessing.
In fact, there are few persons who attained distinction
during the first half of the nineteenth
century of whom the reader will not find an entertaining
and graphic sketch in Goodrich's
"Recollections of a Life Time."</p>

<p>It is a book well worth reading for not only
is it written in an amusing and racy style and
enlivened by anecdote and delightful comment,
but it is a historic review of the politics, literature,
international relations and social life of the
time, put together by a writer eminently qualified
for the task. We are chiefly concerned, however,
with Goodrich's picture of life in the old
town a century ago.</p>

<p>He came here as a youth of seventeen in 1811
and Hartford was his home, though he was frequently
absent in Europe and elsewhere, till
1826 when he moved to Boston.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The city when he arrived was, he says, "a
small commercial town, of four thousand inhabitants,
dealing in lumber and smelling of molasses
and Old Jamaica&mdash;for it had still some trade
with the West Indies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was a high
tone of general intelligence and social respectability
about the place, but it had not a single
institution, a single monument that marked it
as even a provincial metropolis of taste, in literature,
art, or refinement." In this latter respect
things were changed before he left. Trinity
(then Washington) College, the American School
for the Deaf, the Retreat for the Insane and other
philanthropic and educational institutions were
established during his residence in the provincial
capital.</p>

<p>On his arrival he worked as a clerk in a dry
goods store and his intimate friend was George
Sheldon, "favored clerk" in the "ancient and
honored firm" of Hudson &amp; Goodwin, publishers
of the "Connecticut Courant," Webster's
Spelling Book, and much besides. Mr. Goodwin,
of this firm, he describes as "a large, hale, comely
old gentleman, of lively mind and cheerful manners.
There was always sunshine in his bosom
and wit upon his lip. He turned his hand to various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
things, though chiefly to the newspaper,
which was his pet. His heaven was the upper
loft in the composition room; setting type had
for him the sedative charms of knitting work to
a country dame."</p>

<p>At the home of his uncle, Senator Chauncey
Goodrich, he met all the prominent members of
the famous "Hartford Convention," which
finds in him a vigorous defender against the
charge of unpatriotism.</p>

<p>During the War of 1812 he served at New
London as a member of a Hartford artillery
battery, a sort of <i>corps d'élite</i>, under the command
of Captain Nathan Johnson, a well known
lawyer who afterward became general of militia.
Though he was for a few brief moments under
the bombardment of the British ships that were
blockading Decatur, Biddle and Jones in the
Thames, his service was bloodless and he narrates
it with humor and gusto.</p>

<p>He began his career as a publisher in partnership
with Sheldon whose early death terminated
that enterprise. Goodrich himself, however,
here published by subscription the poems of
John Trumbull, whom he knew well, eight
volumes of the Waverly novels, then arousing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
intense interest, and several school books and
"toy books," as he calls them, for children. He
was a leading member of a literary club which
included Bishop J. M. Wainwright, Isaac
Toucey, William M. Stone, Jonathan Law and
S. H. Huntington.</p>

<p>Another literary "cotery," of which Mrs.
Sigourney was the presiding genius, met generally
at Daniel Wadsworth's home. Some of
the poems and papers read at the first of these
clubs were published by Goodrich in a short-lived
periodical called "The Round Table."</p>

<p>We find gossipy sketches of Jeremiah Wadsworth,
Dr. Cogswell and his deaf and dumb
daughter Alice, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet,
Theodore Dwight, the poets Brainard and
Percival, Dr. Strong, pastor of the "Middle
Brick" (the Center) Church, Colonel John
Trumbull, the artist and his beautiful wife, who
was supposed to be the daughter of an English
earl but about whose lineage there was an impenetrable
mystery. Many others of the old
Hartford characters live again in these pages
which furnish us what is doubtless a very accurate,
as well as a very charming impression of the
social life of the old town one hundred years ago.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>But the great world called the future "Peter
Parley" and his ambitions and love of variety
drew him away from the place of his earliest
literary experience to foreign residence and travel
and to the little brown house that he afterward
built at Jamaica Plain. Later in life he returned
again to Europe and for two years was American
Consul at Paris.</p>

<p>He had his failures as well as his successes, his
days of financial losses, as well as of affluence.
He experienced, too, his periods of feeble health.
But he possessed the courage that ancestry like
his often seems to breed and one cannot fail to
accord a hearty tribute to the resolution with
which, in an impaired physical condition, he set
himself, like Mr. Clemens, to overcome adversity
with hard work, with his pen.</p>

<p>His Parley books were the outgrowth of two
impulses or characteristics&mdash;his innate love of
children and his personal rebellion on the one
hand against the dull school books of his boyhood
and on the other against what he considered
such ridiculous and deleterious old fairy stories
as "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Jack the
Giant Killer." He did not think the climax of
"Little Red Riding Hood" was healthy reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for children and he did not at all approve of Jack
the Giant Killer's morals. In his opinion there
was no particular sense in the Mother Goose
jingles.</p>

<p>And so he tried to give children, in the guise
of perfectly proper but at the same time interesting
stories and verses, the information and a
good deal of the education they required. He
may have carried his theory to some extremes,
but he was one of the first among us to realize
that with children effective educational methods
must take into consideration the securing at the
outset of interest and attention.</p>

<p>What extraordinary success he achieved has
already been intimated. Yet it is pathetic to note
that he himself was the first to acknowledge
the fact that his fame would be temporary.
"I have written too much," he says at the height
of his reputation, "and have done nothing really
well. You need not whisper it to the public, at
least until I am gone; but I know, better than
anyone can tell me, that there is nothing in this
long catalogue [of his books] that will give me a
permanent place in literature."</p>

<p>Yet it is safe to say that as long as the human
mind loves to dip into the past and to re-create<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in familiar surroundings the scenes and people
of long ago his "Recollections of a Life Time"
will have its readers. And many of us would
cheerfully relinquish any hope of immortal memory
could we be assured of the love of the countless
children to whom "Peter Parley" was a
dear friend and companion.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a><br /><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a><br /><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII: A Preacher of the Gospel</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT is not often claimed that the small city or
country town produces proportionately more
of the human phenomena popularly denominated
"characters" than does the larger municipality.
Whether this is indeed a fact, or whether the
truth is that in the small group variations from
type are more conspicuous, is perhaps immaterial.
At all events the memories and traditions
of pronounced personalities seem to be frequently
associated with the less populous communities,
especially in New England.</div>

<p>In any review of the personages that lived in
the capital of Connecticut in the last century
the individuality of one of the life-long pastors
of its oldest church stands forth as a shining
example of the capricious and at the same time
engaging forms in which humanity may be
clothed. Above all else the Rev. Doctor Joel
Hawes was a "character."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>To begin with, his personal appearance was
sufficiently extraordinary. Tall, gaunt, awkward,
with large hands and feet, he would have
attracted attention&mdash;and did attract attention&mdash;anywhere.
His face was homely and in repose
unprepossessing, but when he became interested
in talk his expression gathered from the play of
thought an animation which caused his listeners
to forget the essential unattractiveness of his
features.</p>

<p>In many respects there was something Lincoln-like
about him, though he lacked the fine
eyes, the wistful, haunting look, that distinguish
the later portraits of his great contemporary.
Like Lincoln, too, he came from the common
stock and was trained in a rough school. The
story of his tacking loose leaves from the Bible
on the walls of the store, where in his youth he
worked, and memorizing verses between visits
of customers recalls somewhat similar methods
of self-education employed by the boy who became
president. With no money, with no friends
except of his own making, with no "advantages"
or "background," with not even a fair start, he
early developed a tremendous courage and determination;
when to this was added a sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that the hand of God was upon him nothing could
stop him. That in his day he should become one of
the foremost divines in the country was inevitable.</p>

<p>It was his earnestness and force that made him
what he was and not, it must be confessed, any
outstanding brilliancy of mind. His fellow-citizen,
Doctor Bushnell, far excelled him in
mental power, in breadth and originality of
thought, in versatility and imagination. In
Horace Bushnell was always something of the
poet, much of the mystic. His books are bought
today and his name remembered, while Dr.
Hawes, except in his old church and city, is forgotten.
Yet it is to be doubted whether, considering
Joel Hawes's early difficulties and his
moderate mental equipment, one could find a
better example than his life furnished of what
may be accomplished by a man who cherishes a
conviction of personal destiny. He became assured
that God intended him to preach the gospel
and he proceeded to do just exactly that with
confidence, single-mindedness and consequent
success during a long life. His last sermon was
delivered three days before his death.</p>

<p>Here is his theory of the preacher's mission:
"Truth, God's truth especially, is <i>eternally</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<i>must</i> be, interesting to the mind of man; and, if
I can succeed in getting that truth before the
minds of my people, I shall not fail to interest
and instruct all classes of them, be their cultivation
and tastes and habits ever so dissimilar.
This, then, shall be the great, leading object of
my preaching: I will get as much of God's truth
into my sermons as I can".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Might not this principle be adopted to advantage
by many a modern clergyman?</p>

<p>It was in a rough-shod manner, regardless of
obstacles, that Doctor Hawes plowed his way
through life. He did not know how to compromise.
Tact, adaptability, adjustment, finesse,&mdash;these
words were not included in his vocabulary.
He paid little attention to the amenities
of existence, but went directly to his object,
as on the occasion when in prayer meeting, after
lamenting the fact that ordinarily only a few
persons took active part in these gatherings, he
suddenly called upon one diffident attendant,
whose voice had never been heard, with the
peremptory request, "Brother Jones, will you lead
us in prayer&mdash;and we won't take any excuse."</p>

<p>He spoke the plain truth as he saw it, regardless
of whether it was appropriate, or sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
whether it hurt. A distinguished lawyer, no
longer living, once told the writer that when he
was a small boy the doctor met him one day in
the street, stopped him, put his hand on his head,
and, after gazing intently at him for so long that
the child became rather frightened, at last ejaculated,
"Charles, you remind me so much of your
grandfather&mdash;<i>he</i> was a hard-featur'd man!"</p>

<p>This absolute sincerity, this disdain of any
pretense or artificiality, this almost childlike
naïveté, while they furnished many amusing
and sometimes embarrassing incidents, had no
small part in endearing the good man in the
hearts of his people. Indeed the significant thing
about the numerous anecdotes of him that are
still occasionally quoted is that while so many of
them turn on his peculiarities and eccentricities,
none of them seems to detract from the affection
and esteem in which the man and his memory are
held in the traditions of his church. Doubtless
the reason is that these stories essentially serve
to delineate and illumine the portrait of an
intensely earnest, able and vigorous servant of
God and his fellow men.</p>

<p>His humor was not all unconscious. He had
his own notions of the incongruous and diverting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
On one of his journeys abroad he wrote of the
tombs in Westminster Abby&mdash;"There lie in
promiscuous assemblage kings, queens, statesmen,
warriors, poets, scholars, prostitutes, and
villains, each, by his epitaph, now in heaven, but
all awaiting the decisions of the last day, which,
in a great majority of cases, will, it cannot be
doubted, reverse forever the judgment of man."</p>

<p>There was, too, another side to him. Hidden
in the uncouth body was a kindly and sympathetic
heart. Children, at first awed and possibly
repelled by his appearance and manners, soon
grew to love him. His biographer quotes him as
saying that he could never go past a hand-organ
in the street without stopping to listen with the
children and see the monkey.</p>

<p>Sorrow and suffering found in him an instant
response and the instinctive impulse to comfort
and help. Generally these traits, while partly
inherent, are emphasized and made of value to
others, as well as to one's self, by experience.
Doctor Hawes's life had its tragic sorrows and
these were translated into a singular ability to
comfort and help. Then, too, while he would
never compromise for an instant with temptation,
weakness and sin, he could understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
As in the case of most forceful, passionate natures,
his early days, before he discovered the Bible,
had their period of wildness, brief though it was.
In the practical conduct of life he was no theorist,
no amateur. He had struggled against poverty
and loneliness, as he had fought and conquered
the devil in his own life, and he recognized
his old adversary and knew how to deal
with him when he saw the fight going on in the
experience of others.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was all this as much as anything
that constituted the foundation for his interest
in the youth of his church and city. In 1827
this interest resulted in a series of "Lectures to
Young Men" delivered on successive Sunday
evenings to crowded and enthusiastic assemblies
in his own church, and later repeated at Yale
College where subsequently he became a member
of the corporation. The following year the lectures
were published "at the united request" of
his hearers and instantly became famous. "Few
books," says Doctor Walker in his history of the
First Church, "attained a like circulation."
Nearly a hundred thousand copies, in various
editions, were issued in this country and more in
Great Britain. One Scotch publisher alone, asserts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Doctor Walker, printed fifty thousand
copies.</p>

<p>Reading these lectures today, nearly a century
after their composition, one is impressed by the
fact that here is a compendium, as valuable now
as at the time of delivery, of practical rules for a
good and useful life. The titles of the five original
addresses indicate the subject matter&mdash;"Claims
of Society on Young Men;" "Dangers of Young
Men;" "Importance of Established Principles;"
"Formation and Importance of Character;"
"Religion the Chief Concern."</p>

<p>The lectures deal with plain, fundamental
truths, in a straightforward business-like way.
There is as little ornament as imagination about
them; they have more vigor than originality,
but they are bristling with common sense and
set forth with tremendous earnestness the principles
of a practical Christian philosopher.
Epigrammatic touches, indeed, are not wanting.
"A lover of good books," says the lecturer, "can
never be in want of good society;" and again,
"He who cares not for others will soon find that
others will not care for him." "The Gospel may
be neglected," he asserts, "but it cannot be understandingly
disbelieved." "Character is power;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
character is influence," he says, "and he who has
character, though he may have nothing else, has
the means of being eminently useful, not only to
his immediate friends, but to society, to the
church of God, and to the world."</p>

<p>Today the mind of youth is questioning. It is
seeking not only rules for the conduct of life but
a rational interpretation of religious creed and
aspiration that will prove a guide in explorations
on ground that perhaps Doctor Hawes would
have considered forbidden. He was not a meta-physician.
To him the way was plain. The fundamental
truths, the orthodox acceptances,
were good enough for him. The questions that
for long troubled Doctor Bushnell not only did
not worry Doctor Hawes&mdash;he did not understand
why one should ask them. Doctor Bushnell
was ahead of his time. He began where
Doctor Hawes left off, and soon about the
younger man gathered a school of disciples who
shared in sympathy, if not with equality of intellectual
penetration, the tenets of the religious
philosopher, the visions of the seer and poet.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that two such divergent
personalities as Hawes and Bushnell, laborers
in the same field, living in the same city, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
come into conflict. The story of that famous
difference, of the struggles to find common
ground and of the final reconciliation, have today
a note of pathos. For the lay reader it is not easy
at first glance to see what it is all about, and yet
what feeling and bitterness were aroused!</p>

<p>There is no space here to go into the details of
that old dispute. The letters the two ministers
exchanged, like all sincere letters, are typical of
their respective characters and a memorialist of
Doctor Hawes finds nothing for which to apologize
in his side of the correspondence. His letters,
indeed, evidence what a modern theologian
might consider his speculative limitations, but
they show, too, beneath his determination to
adhere to his principles, a genuine grief at the
separation and a hope that the two churches
might be "rooted and grounded in the truth, and
their pastors as happily united in fellowship and
love."</p>

<p>The church of which Doctor Hawes was minister
was, and still is, something more than an
ecclesiastical organization. It is a civic institution.
It founded the town. Its minister takes
rank as a public personage. In this character
Dr. Hawes was interested in many local activities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
An example of this was his connection with the
famous Hartford Female Seminary&mdash;and this
may serve also as another illustration of his interest
in young people. On the Seminary's organization
he was chosen a trustee&mdash;an office he held till
his death. For many years he was its president.
At the reunion of its graduates in 1892, a speaker
who had been one of his "boys," and who was
the executor of his will, gave a little address on
his old pastor which is one of the best portraits
of him that remains.</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Hartford Female Seminary," said
this speaker, "was his especial delight. To its
principals he was a devoted friend; its teachers
were his protegés and assistants; the pupils his
spiritual garden. It was to him the nursery of
all that was best in womanhood. I do not know
how his sober judgment would have ranked, in
relative importance, Yale College, the A. B. C.
F. M., and the Seminary; but I know that in his
affection this school had the warmest place.
How regularly on Monday morning he opened
its sessions with fervent prayer; how benignantly
his benediction fell on the school as he took his
departure, you all know who were in attendance
in his time. And although you may have smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
at his peculiarities, I do not believe a doubt ever
crossed one of your minds that Joel Hawes was
a loving, faithful friend, and truly a man of God."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a><br /><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a><br /><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>




<h2>VIII: A Friend of Lincoln</h2>


<div class='cap'>IN the Spring of 1869 Gideon Welles, who had
been appointed Secretary of the Navy by
Lincoln and had served to the end of the Johnson
administration, returned to Hartford where
he lived till his death in 1878. His diary for May
2, 1869, contains the following entry:</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"We left New York at 3 <span class="small">P. M.</span> and reached Hartford at
seven, stopping at the Allyn House. Nearly four years
have passed since I have been here, more than eight since
I left and took up my residence in Washington.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Hartford itself has greatly altered&mdash;I might say improved&mdash;for
it has been beautified and adorned by many magnificent
buildings, and the population has increased. These
I see and appreciate; but I feel more sensibly than these,
other changes which come home to my heart. A new and
different people seem to move in the streets. Few, comparatively,
are known to me. A new generation which
knows not Joseph is here."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps it was natural that the retiring secretary
of the navy, returning quietly and unannounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and with possibly a trace of the depression
that comes with the relinquishment of
great affairs, should fancy a certain lack of enthusiasm
in his welcome. But a little later, when
he had bought the house, now No. 11 Charter
Oak Place, which was to be his future home, and
his presence was more widely known, he found
his friends more appreciative.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"During the week," he writes some days later, "old
friends have called and welcomed me back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My
old friend, Calvin Day, was absent from the city when I
arrived and did not get home till midnight on Saturday.
As soon as he knew I was here, on Monday morning, he
called. H. A. Perkins, Mrs. Colt, Beach, Seymour, etc.,
etc., called. Mark Howard is absent. Governor Hawley
saw me at breakfast on Wednesday last and immediately
came and greeted me."</p></div>

<p>It is not without interest to note that the
servant question was at the time a great problem.
This, and the confusion of getting settled, of
unpacking loads of furniture, of arranging the
contents of two hundred and twenty-four boxes
that arrived from Washington, while Mrs.
Welles was confined to her room as the result of
a fall, "have made me," he writes, "unused as I
am to these matters, exceedingly uncomfortable."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Nevertheless, there is some mitigation,
as this entry shows:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Met Mr. Hamersley&mdash;who invited me to his store,
where we had an hour, on political subjects chiefly. It is
somewhere about fifteen years since we have had such and
so long a conversation. So far as I have met and seen old
friends, I have had every reason to be satisfied. Though
not very demonstrative or forward in calling, they have
without exception been cordial and apparently sincere."</p></div>

<p>During the nine remaining years of his life
Mr. Welles lived quietly, devoting most of his
time to writing, his chief pieces of work being an
elaborate article claiming for the navy, which he
felt had never received its proper share of the
credit, the most important part in the capture
of New Orleans, and a little volume entitled
"Lincoln and Seward."</p>

<p>The career which he looked back upon in these
last years was one which should have brought to
any man the satisfactions that come from important
work well done. There were, of course,
elements that would naturally interfere with such
satisfactions&mdash;and these a man like Gideon
Welles took to heart more seriously than another
might have done. No one could have served as
he did in high administration during those eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
eventful years without a sense of the blundering,
the waste, the cross-purposes, the petty
motives, and even the treachery that were exhibited
in such a disheartening fashion to those
behind the scenes. But through all this he pursued
steadfastly his honest and able way, not
exempt from bitter criticism, like all his colleagues,
nor from spiteful intrigue. He seems
such a unique and stalwart figure that one is led
to inquire, as one reads his history and his personal
record, why he was not more famous in his
day and time.</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason is that while he had a
remarkable gift of common sense, he lacked a
sense of humor and the sense of proportion that
accompanies it. His diary, it is quite true, is at
times what one would call humorous reading,
but the humor is either unconscious or partakes
of sarcasm. He took life pretty seriously&mdash;and
indeed he had occasion to do so.</p>

<p>Then one infers another characteristic which
is so difficult to define and in its way so subtle
that one hesitates to be dogmatic about it. Yet
reading between the lines of the diary, which is
one of the frankest human documents in the
world, one reader at least gains the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that the author, perhaps realizing the innate
tendency, which the diary shows, to pronounce
judgment, felt before the world the necessity
of putting a curb upon this propensity. In public
he never seems to have asserted himself in
the Rooseveltian manner. He had decided
opinions of his own and was altogether an independent,
fearless person, but he appears to have
been one of the rather reticent members of the
cabinet. A friend tells him on one occasion that
he should have been more forward in expressing
his views and the diary has many references to
times when he judged silence the better course&mdash;as
very likely it was&mdash;for with him silence
never went so far as to constitute consent to anything
he disapproved. Far more single-minded
and straightforward than some of the other cabinet
ministers, he apparently lacked the art, which
many men of smaller caliber possessed, of getting
his personality in a large way before the country.</p>

<p>One feels that here was a capable and high-minded
public servant, with many qualities
which in another personality would have produced
a great leader of men. But there was always
this reticence. Was it possibly the inheritance
of a New England ancestry?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>However, if in his life-time Gideon Welles
lacked the gift for individual prominence that
with some of his contemporaries seemed to be
the main object of life, the publication of his
remarkable "Diary" has, long after his death,
immortalized him. In this journal we have both
a revelation of personal character that is illuminating
and a historic document that is invaluable.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for us that when Gideon Welles
sat down to his diary all restraint and repression
disappeared. His clarity of vision, his firmness
in his belief of what was just and right, his devotion
to duty, his singular ability to estimate men
and to portray character&mdash;all this gives even a
casual reader a very clear conception of what
manner of man he himself was. As for others,
the figures that live forever in these pages are
real people, wrestling in their various characteristic
ways with portentous problems, the solutions
of which we now look back upon as historic
matters long since worked out, but which
in many instances presented very different aspects
at the time from those which now are
obvious to us. It is remarkable how the judgment
of posterity as to individuals has confirmed
Welles's contemporary estimate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>To cite these portraits in detail would be to
give a catalogue of the prominent characters of
the day. At once the greatest and, to the modern
reader the most interesting, is that of Abraham
Lincoln. His personality does not appear complete
and finished in any one description, but is
a composite of comment, conversation and
action recounted from time to time in the pages
covering the period that elapsed before his death.
Thus we see the gradual growing appreciation
of his character from that early day when Welles
noted that "much had been said and was then
uttered by partisans of the incompetency of Mr.
Lincoln and his unfitness," to that later cloudy
morning when, by the bed on which the murdered
President had to be laid diagonally because
of his great height, Welles "witnessed the
wasting life of the good and great man who was
expiring before me." Any reader of the diary
who is also familiar with the latest study of the
war President&mdash;that by Lord Charnwood&mdash;and
who has read or seen Drinkwater's "Lincoln,"
is instantly aware of the value of this journal to
the historian and the dramatist.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ability to depict personality is the
most conspicuous trait of Gideon Welles as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
writer. In this respect he adds to his ability to
gauge character the expressive qualities of the
literary artist. While his estimates of men are
startlingly frank and definite, he is always fair,
even toward those whom he disliked. Even in
those biting, incisive phrases relating to his <i>bête
noir</i>, Senator John P. Hale, there is something
of the inevitable, impersonal condemnation of a
court.</p>

<p>The suggestions of a certain reserve in public
must not be interpreted as implying any hesitation
to express the diarist's convictions when he
considered that the occasion called for them.
Far otherwise. Read, for example, the careful
recitals of those deliberate, overwhelming, sledgehammer
conversational blows the secretary inflicted
on the head of Senator Hale when the
opportunity at last came of loosing long pent-up
emotions. The senator must have emerged from
that interview a stunned, if wiser, man.</p>

<p>And very early in their mutual official connection
the Secretary of State discovered that Mr.
Welles, and only Mr. Welles, was going to run
the Navy Department. When Seward attempted
to interfere surreptitiously with the naval expedition
to relieve Sumter he found himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
a great deal of trouble, the net result of which
may be summarized in the following quotation
from the diary:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"On our way thither [to see the President] Mr. Seward
remarked that, old as he was, he had learned a lesson
from this affair, and that was, he had better attend to his
own business and confine his labors to his own department.
To this I cordially assented."</p></div>

<p>The return of the Secretary to Hartford
brought many memories of old times&mdash;days,
when as editor of the "Hartford Times" he had
worked for Jackson's election, later days when,
slavery being injected as a moral issue into
politics, he had abandoned the democratic creed
and adopted the republican. Then there were
the years when he had served as postmaster, as
member of the general assembly, as state comptroller&mdash;and,
again, that searching period when
for the sake of his convictions he was willing to
face sure defeat as republican candidate for
governor. For eight years he had served as a
member of the republican national committee
and he was chairman of his state delegation to
the convention that nominated for the presidency
the man who was to be afterward his chief
and his staunch friend&mdash;Abraham Lincoln. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
have Lincoln's own word for it, as reported verbatim
in the diary, that there was no wire-pulling
in connection with Gideon Welles's appointment.
The fact that he was a New England man
may have had something to do with it, but the
real consideration was his record.</p>

<p>It was a life full of service for his country and
of devotion to the faith that was in him, that the
old man looked back upon in the closing years.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a><br /><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a><br /><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>




<h2>IX: Our Battle Laureate</h2>


<div class='cap'>ABOUT six months before Gideon Welles
returned to his old home, an ensign in that
navy of which Mr. Welles was, under the President,
commander-in-chief, landed in the port of
New York on the U. S. steam frigate "Franklin".
The "Franklin" bore the flag of Admiral Farragut,
who was returning from a two-year command of
our European Squadron, and the ensign, Henry
Howard Brownell, of East Hartford, was a member
of the great sailor's personal staff on which
he had served during the war.</div>

<p>It was the end of Brownell's service and
travels. Four years later, on October 31, 1872,
at the height of the Grant-Greeley campaign, he
died at the family homestead after a long and distressing
illness. He had been born in 1820. Seven
years before his death Dr. Holmes, in a review in
the "Atlantic" of one of his slim volumes of
verse, had called him "Our Battle Laureate."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Uneven as his verse was, he was a true poet.
A spark of the divine fire had fallen upon him.
Other activities had been attempted, but for
him there clearly was in them no satisfaction.
As a youth he tried mercantile life in New York,
but abandoned it after less than a year. Teaching
seems to have been the practical&mdash;if poetry
is not "practical"&mdash;pursuit which proved most
congenial and it is singular that his first work as
a teacher was in Mobile near which the great
experience of his life later occurred. This short
sojourn in the South came after his graduation
in 1841 from Trinity College and was followed
by study of the law in Hartford where he was
admitted to the bar and for a short time practiced
in partnership with his brother Charles.</p>

<p>But the law was not for him. The poetic muse
was always whispering in his ear. He saw visions
and dreamed dreams&mdash;witness his "Song of the
Archangels." Yet he was rather a direct and
rugged sort of poet. Subtlety and indirection,
fine shadings, carefully wrought lines, had little
place in his methods. He appears to have been
impatient of revision. He felt deeply and the
need of expression was instant. Often he wrote,
as he states in the preface to "Lyrics of a Day,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<i>currente calamo</i>, and most of his verses were seen
first in the pages of the Hartford newspapers.
In the light of modern technique many of them
seem already a little old-fashioned. Perhaps the
present-day undergraduate would call some of
them "simple." Yet any of our young intellectuals
might be proud of having written "In
Articulo Mortis"; surely there is nothing very
simple about "The Sphinx." And one is occasionally
startled by lines that have the perfect, the
inevitable phrase&mdash;as in these from "The Tomb
of Columbus"&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the fragrant breath</span><br />
Of unknown tropic flowers came o'er my path,<br />
Wafted&mdash;how pleasantly! for I had been<br />
Long on the seas, and their soft, waveless glare<br />
Had made green fields a longing."<br />
</div>

<p>It would be difficult to improve on that last
line. Again&mdash;to most readers there will come a
swift and dramatic vision from the two stanzas
of "Qu'il Mourut"&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Not a sob, not a tear be spent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">For those who fell at his side&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But a moan and a long lament</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">For him&mdash;who might have died!</span><br />
<br />
"Who might have lain, as Harold lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A King, and in state enow&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or slept with his peers, like Roland</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">In the Straits of Roncesvaux."</span><br />
</div>

<p>In all his early verse there is much that is
haunting and memorable, together with much
that is trivial and even flippant, It was the coming
of the Civil War that made Henry Brownell
known as a poet. Indeed he published little before
that time.</p>

<p>In our own day we have had great moral issues
in war and we have known what the response to
them could be. These issues were, however, involved
with many other peoples, their application
was, in a way, diffused; to different races
they presented different aspects. But the Civil
War was our <i>own</i> war, its issues were concentrated;
it not only involved national honor, it
concerned, and vitally concerned, the question
whether the nation should live.</p>

<p>To these portentous messages and alarms,
borne on every breath of the wandering breezes
of those tense days, the spirit of Henry Brownell
responded with an intuitive instinct, a poetic
eloquence, akin to that of the seers and the
prophets.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"World, art thou 'ware of a storm?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Hark to the ominous sound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How the far-off gales their battle form,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And the great sea swells feel ground!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>In 1860, the Hartford papers were full of his
"fiery lyrics" and the writer&mdash;was it Hawley or
Warner?&mdash;of an appreciation of Brownell in the
"Courant" shortly after his death tells how
well he remembered the day in the anxious winter
of 1860-61 when Brownell brought into the office
of the old "Evening Press" the manuscript of
"Annus Memorabilis"&mdash;verses breathing a resolution
and exaltation of courage that brought a
generous measure of fame. There is something
about "Annus Memorabilis"&mdash;not only the
meter which is the same&mdash;that suggests Macaulay's
"Naseby," something, too, remotely suggestive
of Kipling. Into this mood of exaltation
there ran occasionally a vein of humor that
only deserves mention in the case of the verses
"Let Us Alone," inspired by Jefferson Davis's
statement in his inaugural address, "All we
want is to be left alone." Though of little poetic
merit these lines caught the popular fancy and
were long remembered and quoted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>And so the war came on, and the poet's vision,
which had been laughed at by some readers, was
justified by events. There came defeats, almost
countless deaths, occasional victories, doubts of
final victory&mdash;all the ebb and flow and waste of
war&mdash;and to it all the sensitive but vigorous
spirit responded in many chords. Of the gentler
lays, the most winning to the writer are the
verses called "The Battle Summers." Here are
a few of the stanzas&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"All vain&mdash;Fair Oaks and Seven Pines!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A deeper hue than dying Fall</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">May lend, is yours!&mdash;yet over all</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The mild Virginian autumn smiles,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .</span><br />
<br />
"We pass&mdash;we sink like summer's snow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Yet on the mighty Cause shall move,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Though every field a Cannae prove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And every pass a Roncesvaux.</span><br />
<br />
"Through every summer burn anew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A battle summer,&mdash;though each day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">We name a new Aceldema,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or some dry Golgotha re-dew."</span><br />
</div>

<p>On the whole, however, it was the magnificence,
the drama, of the struggle that possessed
him&mdash;sometimes the realization of the tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
stakes for which the game was played,
sometimes the actual, objective romance of
events, as in the beginning of the famous "River
Fight"&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Would you hear of the River Fight?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It was two of a soft spring night&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">God's stars looked down on all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all was clear and bright.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the low fog's chilling breath&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Up the River of Death</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sailed the Great Admiral."</span><br />
</div>

<p>His own participation in the fighting came
about in a strange way. He paraphrased in verse,
first published in the "Evening Press," the
rather dramatic general orders preparatory to the
"River Fight." Poetically it was not a great performance,
but in some way it came to the attention
of Farragut who was greatly impressed. The
acquaintance thus begun resulted in the unusual
appointment of Brownell as master's mate on
Farragut's staff and, shortly thereafter, as ensign,
with the duties of secretary.</p>

<p>One can fancy the lift and glory in the heart
of this rather retiring poet and teacher, with a
hitherto unsatisfied thirst for action and drama,
as he stood on the quarter-deck of the "Hartford"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
fighting her way up Mobile Bay on that
early August morning in 1864. At last he was
in the midst of great events. This was his
crowded hour&mdash;and the gods gave him full
measure. Even in plain prose it is a gallant
story. What a life-time must have been lived in
those moments when Craven's monitor "Tecumseh",
off to port, making for the Confederate
ram "Tennessee", struck a torpedo and went
down; when the "Brooklyn", leading the column,
just ahead of the "Hartford", backed
down upon the flag-ship, in fear of more torpedoes;
when Farragut, lashed in the rigging, saw
his line doubling up in confusion close under the
Confederate batteries! It was then occurred the
famous colloquy and order. "What is the
trouble?" was asked of the "Brooklyn" by the
flag-ship and the answer&mdash;"Torpedoes." "Damn
the torpedoes!" shouted the Admiral. "Captain
Drayton, go ahead! Jouett, full speed!" And
the "Hartford," increasing speed rapidly, passed
under the stern of the "Brooklyn" and took the
lead, firing her starboard batteries as fast as the
men could work. One did not need to be a poet
to secure a thrill from such a situation, but what
must it have meant to the creative imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that till then had pictured such scenes only in
fancy!</p>

<p>And this was only the early part of the fight.
Through it all Brownell took notes, as he had
been ordered, of the progress of the action and
literally wrote at least one stanza of "The Bay
Fight." During the battle he dropped one of his
papers which was later found and returned to
him with an expression of admiration that he
could write so legibly in the midst of such excitement.
"If I were killed," he replied, "I
didn't want any of you to think I'd been afraid."</p>

<p>Probably "The Bay Fight" was Brownell's
most famous poem, though "The River Fight"
is generally classed with it. The ballad has its
faults. It is too long and too detailed for modern
taste. It is ragged in places&mdash;the poet made his
own versification much of the time. But it has
vigor, vividness and sincere emotion, and through
it all runs the turmoil and thunder of the battle.
"The Bay Fight" has been compared to the work
of Campbell, Drayton and Tennyson&mdash;yet no
one has suggested a special likeness in temper
and methods, in its narrative portions, to "The
Ballad of the Revenge" of which it reminded
one reader. At the close, where the meter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
changes to a quieter rhythm, there are a tenderness
and aspiration and felicity of phrasing that
arrest even the casual reader&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The verse of the Great War and that of the Civil
War show one marked contrast. The best poetry
of the recent titanic struggle is individualistic.
It reflects the re-actions of personality to the
stress and tension, the long-drawn, desperate
drudgery, the tragedy, and sometimes the humor,
of the strange experience. It pictures the dreams
of home and peace. Most of the best of it has
been written by young soldiers, many of whom
were novices in the poetic rôle. On the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the well-known poets did not come up to expectations.
There were of course exceptions, but
most of this recent verse, appealing and beautiful
as it is, misses the higher vision, perhaps because
the immediate scene and the personal experience
were so overwhelming. The poets of
our Civil War, however, were obsessed with the
meaning of it all, with the hopes and fears for the
country's future. Have we as yet anything in
American verse about the Great War that we
can place beside the best war poetry of Holmes
and Whittier? Can we find sustained poetic inspiration
that compares with Lowell's "Commemoration
Ode"? Whereas to this recent conflict
is the lyric power of the "The Battle Hymn of
the Republic"? And, coming down to mere
narrative and descriptive verse, what incident
of this modern Armageddon has found among
us its immortal ballad, as the battle of Mobile
Bay found its eloquent poetic record in "The
Bay Fight"?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a><br /><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a><br /><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a><br /><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>




<h2>X: The Temple of the Muses</h2>


<div class='cap'>TO older citizens the Wadsworth Atheneum
has an especial and peculiar charm. Doubtless
more recent residents also feel this attraction,
but it is natural that to those who as children
lived in its shadow, as it were, the appeal should
be strongest.</div>

<p>Here we were wont to go on rainy afternoons
to look at the illustrated papers in the reading
room. In the historical society's quarters upstairs
it used to give one a peculiar thrill to sit
on the link of the chain which during the Revolution
was stretched across the Hudson at West
Point, and which we had read about in the
"Boys of 'Seventy-Six." There was, too, a certain
ghastly emotional experience to be derived
from an inspection of the sword holes, just over
the heart, in the waistcoat and shirt of Colonel
Ledyard. Then there were those Saturday
mornings spent with the good friend of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
children in the weekly proceedings at the Atheneum
of the old "Agassiz Association."</p>

<p>In those days we were reading "Kenilworth"
and "Woodstock" and the castellated structure
acquired in our minds a quality of mystery and
romance. Certain precincts of the building were
denied us and an impression gained credence
that somewhere in the edifice, the plan of which
we never fathomed, were secret rooms, passages
and staircases. Certainly if ghosts walked anywhere
the place where you would be most
likely to find them was on some Hallowe'en
midnight among these relics of the past. But we
never got in at midnight&mdash;in fact nothing could
have persuaded us to attempt such an entry.</p>

<p>More mature experience removed something
of the mystery, but the charm never entirely
vanished. It came, however, to be exercised in
different ways. Perhaps it was necessary during
vacations to supplement college reading by the
use of the historical society's library, then installed
in the delightful quarters that had been
the first home of the Watkinson collection. In
many ways it seems a pity that this old library,
with its oak bookshelves, arranged in alcoves, its
galleries and delightful little staircases, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
abandoned for modern, but less atmospheric
quarters. It was a charming room and the only
place of its kind in the state, except the old
library at Yale, the proposed alteration of which
recently created such a storm of opposition.</p>

<p>It was discovered, however, that the newer
and larger Watkinson Library also offered a
quiet refuge when one wanted to study or read
without interruption. Here, too, were and still
are alcoves, galleries and staircases, but loftier,
more imposing and triumphant than in the
intimate and friendly and older library. The
main room of the Watkinson is, however, an
alluring spot where one may escape from the
financial implications of the immediate environment
into a world with which money and business
have little to do.</p>

<p>Increasing years brought an interest in the
old portraits. Our childhood acquaintance with
the pictorial features of the Atheneum was
chiefly confined to Trumbull's paintings of the
Revolutionary battles. These seemed to us at
the time perfect representations of what really
happened at Bunker Hill, Princeton and Quebec.
But the inevitable development of a more
catholic artistic sense led us to dwell with a growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
interest on the work of some of the great
masters displayed in the art gallery. With these
the portraits of state and local worthies in the
historical society's rooms could not compete
very successfully from the standpoint of workmanship,
but these local portraits acquired a
new importance as the story of the state and the
old town took its place in our enlarging appreciation
of relative values. At least we could
gather from them some idea of what the people
looked like who had walked the streets where we
had played as children and who had taken their
parts in the building of the city, the state and
the nation.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">

<span class="caption">THE WATKINSON LIBRARY</span>
</div>
<p>We heard the story of Elizabeth Whitman and
the portraits of her father and mother became
something more than merely faded old pictures.
Oliver Ellsworth was no longer only a name&mdash;there
he was, sitting at a table with his wife, his
familiar house visible in the distance. And when
curiosity grew as to Daniel Wadsworth, the
founder of the Atheneum, we were able to satisfy
this in some degree by hunting up the two portraits
of him&mdash;one as a boy, leaning on his
father's shoulder, the other Ingham's painting
of him in middle life.</p>




<div class='center'><br />ii</div>

<p>It is strange that so little has been written
about Daniel Wadsworth. He was the original
Maecenas of Hartford. But he had no Horace
to celebrate him and he would have abhorred
the publicity which the Roman patron of the
arts and letters seems rather to have enjoyed.
His modesty is well illustrated by the fact that
he requested that Dr. Hawes should at his
funeral services attempt no formal eulogy, in the
fashion of the day. He died at ten minutes past
one on the morning of July 28, 1848, a few days
before his seventy-seventh birthday. Though he
lived to this advanced age his health was always
frail and this fact may account, in part, for
his rather retiring disposition.</p>

<p>He was, however, by no means a recluse. His
home, altered, but still standing at the southwest
corner of Prospect Street and Atheneum
Street&mdash;formerly "Wadsworth's Alley,"&mdash;now
laboring under the alliterative title of "Atheneum
Annex," was the center of a simple and delightful
social life. In its notice of Mr. Wadsworth
after his death the "Courant" said of this
home that it "has remained for half a century
a scene of cheerful hospitality, where persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a><br /><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of humble worth as well as those of distinction,
have been received with kindness and courtesy,
and cheered by the unclouded sunshine of Mrs.
Wadsworth's benevolence and lovely manners."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wadsworth was the daughter of the
second Governor Trumbull. "Her mind," says
Dr. Hawes, in the funeral sermon which in his
wife's case Mr. Wadsworth did not prohibit,
"was sprightly, inquisitive, well-balanced and
excellently cultivated; her temper was uncommonly
mild, affectionate and cheerful, often exhibiting
a pleasant playfulness of spirit, enlivening
conversation and intercourse, but never light,
censorious or severe; her heart replete with tenderness,
and alive to every social and sympathetic
feeling." She died two years before her husband.
Their married life extended over fifty-three years.</p>

<p>After her death a Miss Sarah McClellan, who
seems to have been a connection of Mrs. Wadsworth,
appeared in the character of secretary
for Mr. Wadsworth, who was very feeble during
the last two years of his life. She kept a diary,
now in the possession of the Connecticut Historical
Society, through which we get contemporary
glimpses of the kindly life of the old
street, though most of the references are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
nature of a catalogue of visits paid and received,
such as,&mdash;</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Jan. 1, 1848. Received a beautiful book as a New
Year's present from Mrs. Sigourney .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Judge Ellsworth,
Doctor Grant, Mr. Clair [Clerc?] and Mr. Barnard
called in the morning. <span class="small">P. M.</span> Judge Williams, Mr. Smith
[Alfred?], Mr. Roswell and John Parsons called. Went
down to see Mrs. Hudson&mdash;found her better."</p></div>

<div class='unindent'>On another occasion she records how Dr. Grant
brought to the house four children, aged from
nine to thirteen, known as the "Apollonians,"
who were to give a concert in the evening and
who sang to Mr. Wadsworth at his home as he
was not well enough to attend the concert. After
they had left Miss McClellan went to Dr. Grant's
"and took a galvanic shock for my painful arm."</div>

<p>The most valuable part of the diary historically,
however, relates to the last illness of Mr.
Wadsworth and his death on a night of midsummer
thunderstorms, and this is rather long
and rather intimate for quotation.</p>

<p>In fact most of our knowledge of the founder
of the Atheneum comes more from memories and
traditions than from exact data. These legends
picture him as a fragile man with a stoop, fond of
wearing even in the house, an artist's cap and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
cloak, partly to protect himself from drafts, of
which he had an exaggerated dread, partly, we
fancy, to exemplify in his person his artistic
ideals.</p>

<span class='small'>BY PERMISSION OF</span><br />
<span class='small'>THE CONNECTICUT HISTORICAL SOCIETY</span></span>
</div>

<p>For art was his great interest in life and his
wealth enabled him to gratify his artistic inclinations
and to perpetuate in the city he loved a
center for the humanities which to him seemed
so far above riches. In a way he was a cosmopolitan,
for he had been educated in France and
England, accompanying his father, Jeremiah
Wadsworth, there when he was twelve years old.
Many of the paintings and prints, of which he
was an inveterate collector, came from Europe&mdash;as
most examples of good art then did.</p>

<p>He was himself an illustrator and painter.
The illustrations of his friend's&mdash;Professor Benjamin
Silliman's&mdash;"Tour From Hartford to
Quebec," are by him and they include two
views of his beautiful country seat, "Monte
Video," on Talcott Mountain. It is characteristic
of Professor Silliman's regard for what were
doubtless his friend's wishes that Mr. Wadsworth's
name is not mentioned in his description
of the spot. We know of at least one home, and
there are probably several, where attractive and
interesting sketches and paintings by Mr. Wadsworth
are still cherished.</p>

<p>As the years increased upon him the care of
his health seems to have become something of a
pre-occupation. It is related that he had a series
of capes of differing colors and sizes which he
superimposed one upon another, as the weather
grew colder, attracting thus considerable attention
in his walks abroad. In his big yellow coach
he installed a stove in cold weather, and a smoke-stack,
which may have caused our fellow citizens
of that day to wonder whether they were beholding
a steamboat on wheels&mdash;or even a motor
vehicle of the period. Into his pew in the southwest
corner of the Center Church he invariably
had a foot stove carried when attending service
in winter.</p>

<p>Looking back through the years the life of
his time seems to have had a more friendly and
neighborly element than our urgent affairs today
appear to permit. Perhaps there is something of
fancy in this, but it is not all fancy to believe that
in the institution that bears his name Daniel
Wadsworth has transmitted to succeeding generations
a flavor and memory of this old life, as
well as an opportunity to know the refreshment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a><br /><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of certain things that can not be measured in
money&mdash;the things of the mind and the spirit.</p>


<div class='center'><br />iii</div>

<p>On the whole, the portion of the Atheneum
that was the most popular with the children of
an older day, and became through familiarity
the least mysterious, was the reading room.
In retrospect this room seems to have had a
distinct quality of its own. For one thing it
appears, in memory, to have been characterized
by a pervading aroma of wet umbrellas, rubbers
and damp clothing. Probably this is due to the
fact that one generally frequented it on rainy
days when out-of-door pursuits were impossible.
Somebody was always opening a window to let
in a little air.</p>

<p>At that time the room was in the northeast
corner of the main building. Its chief furnishings
were the many rows of oak reading desks,
shaped like inverted V's, raised on standards to
a convenient height. To these slanting surfaces
the papers were clamped by wooden contrivances
which materially interfered with a comprehensive
view of all double page pictures.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless one rather approved of these
old oak reading desks. They gave a studious air
to the room and separated the floor space into
sections that contributed a certain effect of
privacy. Also they concealed the upper portions
of readers on opposite sides, or in different sections,
from one another. It was rather diverting
to peek underneath and endeavor to construct
mentally from the shoes, trousers and skirts&mdash;they
were long enough in those days&mdash;thus
visible, the respectively corresponding upper
sections of anatomy. After a creative effort of
this kind it was interesting to move around to
the other side and see how nearly right you were.</p>

<p>On the whole the English illustrated papers
were the most popular of the periodicals and
sometimes in the attempt to secure exclusive
possession of these there was a good deal of
squabbling which had to be terminated by the
young woman in charge, who, however, was
reasonably tolerant and far more popular than
the dragon who guarded the historical museum
upstairs.</p>

<p>The first real war any of us remembered was
then in progress and the "Illustrated London
News" and the London "Graphic" were full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
pictures of British warships bombarding Alexandria
and of charging Highlanders at Tel-el-Kebir.
Though soon supplanted by our own
"Life," "Punch," too, was something of a
favorite, with its drawings by Du Maurier of
tall, wasp-waisted, beautiful ladies with remarkable
coiffures and trailing skirts, and of men with
Dundreary whiskers, frock coats, top hats and
monocles&mdash;all engaged in what seemed to us
singularly inane conversation. Most of us had
"St. Nicholas" at home and of the other American
publications "Harper's Young People"
easily held first place, with "Harper's Weekly" a
close second. The girls were often discovered
poring over "Harper's Bazaar"&mdash;an inexplicable
thing to the masculine mind. That seemed
to us a silly paper.</p>

<p>In time certain habitués of the reading room
became familiar to us&mdash;by sight, that is. There
was, of course, the nondescript crowd of persons
out of employment, or idlers, who came in to get
warm or to pass an hour or two. These were the
floating population, as it were, and the individuals
varied with the seasons. Some of them seemed
to be searching the advertising columns of the
dailies for a job. Others read strange technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
papers&mdash;engineering magazines or trade journals.
One has often wondered since what perennial
hopes, what latent ambitions, what undiscovered
geniuses, were concealed amid this
rather drab clientele of the reading room.</p>

<p>But that some definite purposes animated
certain devotees could not be doubted&mdash;though
what the exact individual motives were was not
always apparent. There was, for example, the
queer old man&mdash;short, stocky, with gray beard
and spectacles&mdash;whose specialty seemed to be
the New York papers and the political and
economic magazines. He was generally supposed
to be a little "off" and he had Doctor Johnson's
habit when walking along the street of tapping
with his stick every post and tree he passed.
If he abstractedly missed one he would go back
and rap it. We often noticed unkind urchins of
our own age following him and reminding him
of any omissions, for the intense joy of seeing
him invariably return and perform this rite. Let
us hope that none of us attempted this, though
it can not be asserted that the temptation was
always resisted, even if no memory of succumbing
to it remains.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was another frequenter of the
reading room who was generally supposed to be
not quite normal mentally. He was a kindly,
gentle soul, however, and it is pleasant to remember
that he was never the subject of ridicule.
Indeed his deprecating manner, his invariable
courtesy, even to children, effectually disarmed
any suggestion of the sort. We all liked
him and perhaps he did not dislike us. He
would come softly in, with bent head and humble
air, put his umbrella in the rack, look about to
ascertain what favorite papers of his had not
been pre-empted, slide with the effect of an
apology into some empty place, put on his
spectacles, get out his note book and pencil and
begin to transcribe. During each of his visits he
was continually taking notes and the imagination
is appalled at any effort to compute the
number of note books he must have filled, for he
was a constant visitor. The occupation was of
course an obsession, a phase, no doubt, of various
mental vagaries he harbored. Probably
as children we missed something of the pathos of
the fine mind thus clouded, but it is a comfort to
remember that we did not altogether fail in
appreciation of the spirit of the gentleman.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>There comes dimly to memory the figure of a
rather elderly woman who wore an old-fashioned
bonnet and rather odd clothing of a bygone
style. She was a busy person, flitting from paper
to paper, forever in quest of some apparently
elusive data. It seemed to be necessary for her
to hold frequent consultations with the attendant.
These were carried on, for her part, in loud,
hissing whispers that were far more penetrating
and distracting than ordinary conversation
would have been and the good-natured presiding
genius of the room spent much of her time looking
up references for this curious and acquisitive
visitor. What she was seeking we never knew,
but, though it was manifestly of the utmost importance
to her, one could not escape the impression
of futility. Surely a public reference or
reading room is an excellent place in which to
study the caprices of the human mind.</p>

<p>This person's audible conferences with the attendant
bring to mind the notice that was prominently
posted in various parts of the room,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Loud Talking or Prolonged<br />
Conversation Will Not Be<br />
Allowed In This Room</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that the statute of limitations has barred
civil, if not criminal proceedings, the writer will
confess that some years later, when an undergraduate
of Yale College, he abstracted, after
the unoriginal fashion of his kind, one of these
notices and took great pride in displaying it in
a prominent place on the wall of his room at
college where its apt and ironic message aroused
great envy and admiration.</p>

<p>But to return to our memories of the reading
room's habitués&mdash;there was Cousin George.
This vicarious relative was an unattached Congregational
minister who sojourned in the city
from time to time. The nomadic character of his
ministry was due partly to principle, partly to a
kind of wanderlust. In this old bachelor there
was a wandering streak&mdash;he was not happy for
long in one place. But he had a strong social
instinct and a keen interest in and affection for
his friends and was greatly beloved by them. A
great purveyor of news, he was an insatiable
reader of the papers and toward the middle of
the morning he invariably came into the reading
room, as into a club, to look through the news
of the day. His soft, black hat, overcoat with
short shoulder cape, eyeglasses with black ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and mutton-chop whiskers gave a distinct
individuality to his appearance. About his looks
there was an effect of oddity&mdash;and indeed, like
most of us, he had his whimseys and peculiarities.
There was little externally to indicate his
kindly sympathy, his talent for friendship, his
thoughtfulness for others, particularly for the
sick. For that reason, doubtless, it was not until
maturer years that that side of his character
fully dawned on one. There was nothing to denote
this in the picture of him, seated in a good
reading light, in one corner of the room, his cape-overcoat
thrown back on his shoulders, his thin
legs crossed, absorbed in last night's "New York
Evening Post."</p>

<p>Like the others we have mentioned he will
never come to the reading room again. Did they,
we wonder, surmise that certain small eyes were
observing them, that certain youthful personalities
were conferring about them, that certain
immature minds were striving to grasp what
manner of men and women they were? Truly
memories of us all may live long in unsuspected
places.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a><br /><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a><br /><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a><br /><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>




<h2>XI: The Friend of Youth</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was announced the other day in the public
prints that the Private Coachman's Benevolent
Association had filed its certificate of dissolution.
Over this laconic statement in the morning
paper one reader, at least, paused and let his
thoughts wander. To him there seemed a significant
and, indeed, a rather melancholy interest in
the announcement. The incident thus briefly
mentioned not only marked the end of an ancient
brotherhood; it furnished a striking commentary
on changing social conditions.</div>

<p>As a type the private coachman is disappearing,
and with him vanish the coaches, landeaus
and victorias, the well-matched pairs of reliable
family horses with shining harnesses and jingling
chains, the snappy trotters, the buggy rides and
the horse in general as a voucher of social responsibility
and standing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The possession of a motor car and the services
of a chauffeur, though generally involving more
financial outlay than a stable and coachman
necessitated, somehow do not quite confer the
reflected glory in which the employer of a coachman
used to shine. Everybody has a motor and
the very prevalence and numerousness of the
chauffeur, capable and loyal soul though he be,
necessarily detract from the distinction which
the rarer coachman used to give.</p>

<p>One usually stood rather in awe of the coachman&mdash;particularly
in boyhood, the period with
which he is chiefly associated in the memories of
most of us. He was a person of strange and exalted
attainments. He held mysterious and telepathetic
communication with his horses. He
understood them, and they him. He had theories
about shoeing, he could prescribe for most of
their ailments, he hissed at them queerly as he
groomed them. Moreover, he had the real sporting
spirit. He knew all about the performances
of Maud S. and John L. Sullivan. He called the
firemen and policemen by their first names and
the fire bell would send him running out of the
stable at any hour.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>If the boy wanted to acquire a puppy he got
the coachman to select it and to clip its ears
(without anæsthetic) behind the stable&mdash;or, if
the coachman was wise, he persuaded a friend
to do this surgical work at some livery stable, out
of earshot of the family. Probably when the
puppy was grown the coachman surreptitiously
staged fights with him against rival dogs, chaperoned
by brother coachmen, late at night after
the boy and his elders were asleep, thus occasionally
providing a precarious addition to his wages
if the dog came up to expectation. To tell the
truth, it was generally selected for its fighting
qualities.</p>

<p>He had strange tales of adventure, many of
them doubtless fictitious, but showing the swift
imagination of the race from which he generally
sprang. The great event of his life was his trip
to Philadelphia at the time of the Centennial
when he was temporarily a soldier and had
charge of the major's horse. For years brilliant
lithographs of the exhibition buildings were
tacked to the stable wall above the shelf where
stood bottles of horse liniment and harness
dressing. He had seen men and cities and out of
his experience had grown a practical and homely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
wisdom that was by no means lost upon his
young admirers. He was the friend of youth.</p>

<p>And now it seems that the guild is officially
extinct. Hail and farewell, private coachman!
Though legally dissolved you are not forgotten,
but remain ever enshrined in our memories of
an older and simpler day.</p>

<p>In those memories the coachman assumes
multiform incarnations. The individuals varied
as the years of childhood lengthened, but they
all conformed to type.</p>

<p>At the end of one of those dim vistas of childish
recollections, illumined by the mellow light
that always plays about our earliest remembrances,
stands the figure of Patrick, the first
coachman of them all. His first appearance was
so very long ago&mdash;as a life-time is measured&mdash;that
the vision, emerging from the mists in which
the first consciousness of the world is enveloped,
is painted somewhat vaguely on the retina of the
mind. How much of it is real, how much an
idealized memory, can not perhaps be definitely
determined. After all, it is only a picture and a
feeling.</p>

<p>One seems to remember being enthroned on a
rug spread on the grass of the garden, beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the big apple tree, in the level sunlight of a late
afternoon in spring. It must have been spring
for the apple tree was in bloom. About one,
seated on the grass, was grouped a circle of the
maids of the household and their visitors. No
experience of later years has ever given the
slightest intimation that one could possibly be
or became such a center of interest and admiration
as that microcosm of dawning intelligence
then consciously was to that laudatory audience.
There was a distinct sense of being the source of
the happiness and laughter that composed the
mental atmosphere of that golden afternoon.
Such an assurance that the world was entirely
good and beautiful has not since been attained.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Patrick was added to the
circle&mdash;a smooth-shaven, apple-cheeked, merry
man&mdash;having doubtless strolled over from the
neighboring stable yard. Was it partly because
a masculine note of admiration was added to the
feminine chorus that the effect of general well-being
and of mirth seemed, with his arrival, to
be emphasized and confirmed? At all events
there was an instinctive perception between
Patrick and the center of interest that they
understood each other, and Patrick was welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
from the rug with evidences of the recognition
of this bond which precipitated another
wave of delightful worship.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a firm friendship.
Patrick soon shared with the nurse of those
Elysian days the early confidences, the awakening
and absurd aspirations, of the childish mind.
In the first cloud of trouble, which after some
years grew from the marriage and departure of
the nurse, he was a never failing solace. He received
with serious consideration a carefully
thought-out plan to compel her return by engaging
one of the hook and ladder companies
to pull down her new home, thus presumably
leaving her without any abiding place but the
parental roof. Seated on the front seat of the
old carriage with his young friend, taking the air
about the city, he assisted in plotting the details
of this scheme. It was so subtly diluted by other
interests, and disappeared so gradually, that
no particular disillusion resulted.</p>

<p>Why Patrick left and when remain a mystery.
He was succeeded by a Scotchman with reddish
whiskers and for long was lost to sight. Then,
unexpectedly, he re-appeared.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon, years afterward, while calling
at a friend's home and talking over old days, it
developed that Patrick was still alive&mdash;a very
old man now&mdash;that he was employed by these
friends as gardener&mdash;that, as a matter of fact,
he was at the moment at work in the garden. It
was, indeed, possible to see him from the window.
What was the meaning of that instant sense
of doubt as to whether it would be well to walk
over to the window? At least this hesitancy did
not prevail and there, in a far corner, raking
among the shrubbery, could be discerned the
figure of a little, bowed old man in blue denim
overalls and a weather-beaten felt hat. One
could not see his face&mdash;his back was toward the
window. How small he looked! Why, Patrick
had been a fine figure of a young Irishman, not
tall, perhaps, but of a respectable height.</p>

<p>The suggestion was inevitable that it would
be interesting to go over and talk to him. Indeed
a start was made, but again came that impulse
of hesitation, stronger this time and not to be
gainsaid. Was Patrick well&mdash;was he happy?
On the whole the answer was in the affirmative.
He had, it appeared, touches of rheumatism,
but he could still do light work, and he liked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
putter about the lawns and the flower beds. At
home he was comfortable. Generally speaking, it
seemed that life had treated him not too harshly.
It was clear that he was with kindly people&mdash;and
there one left him.</p>

<p>After all, it is comforting to realize that the
picture of Patrick that is best remembered is not
of a bent old man, leaning somewhat heavily
upon his rake, but of the figure that takes shape
out of the mists of childhood&mdash;a figure that
somehow always personifies the attributes of
kindliness and sympathy&mdash;standing in a long
vanished garden, beneath an apple tree in bloom.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a><br /><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a><br /><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>




<h2>XII: The Christmas Party</h2>


<div class='cap'>WE always stood rather in awe of Raymond's
Uncle Horace because it was
said he had once taught Latin in a boys' school.
Any one who had ever wielded the power of a
teacher was a person with a background of authority
and importance whom one could not
approach too familiarly. Indeed, it would have
been difficult to be familiar with Raymond's
Uncle Horace under any conceivable circumstances,
for he was essentially a dignified and aloof
person.</div>

<p>It was understood that the abandonment of
teaching had been caused by failing health and to
the same origin was perhaps due the reserve and
apparent preoccupation that militated against
any real intimacy with his nephew's young
friends. There was some vague story of a young
wife who had died years before, but an experience
of that sort was so far beyond our comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that the rumor added but little to the
isolation in which Raymond's uncle seemed to
dwell. He was never really an actor in the drama
of our young lives. Sometimes appearing in the
wings, more often in the critic's seat, he was an
onlooker rather than a participant.</p>

<p>One remembers him chiefly as walking back
and forth on the old street between Raymond's
grandfather's house and certain indefinite rooms
he dwelt in which were probably in the edifice
then known as the Charter Oak building.</p>

<p>The impression that persists is of one very
carefully wrapped up against the weather. He
wore a long ulster, a seal-skin cap, with a visor,
and about his neck, under his iron-gray beard,
a muffler was efficiently disposed. His large,
gold-rimmed spectacles gave him the customary
owlish, peering expression, but in spite of them
he could not seem to recognize us, or any one
else, except when close at hand. He carried a
stout walking stick, the point of which he never
raised from the ground, but dragged after him
between alternate steps and he stood so straight
that he appeared to lean a little backward. It
would seem that in the warmer seasons this
habitual manner of dress must have been modified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
but there is no recollection of any other
costume.</p>

<p>A tradition of immense learning clung about
him. It was said that in his mysterious rooms
the walls were lined with books which he spent
all his time in reading. It was even whispered
that he read Latin and Greek for fun&mdash;and no
higher intellectual achievement than this could
be imagined. There was something facile and
careless, too, about the idea of reading for
pleasure dead languages with which we had as
yet no acquaintance but which loomed as
educational obstacles in the not distant future.
This casual facility appealed to our youthful
sporting spirit and compelled a reluctant
admiration. Whatever Raymond's uncle's
shortcomings as an intimate might be, he had at
least reached the point where matters that were
soon to be weighty problems to us were to him
merely a question of amusement.</p>

<p>Raymond's grandparents lived in an old house
around the corner from the old street. Their
home was, in fact, one of the oldest houses in the
city. They were people of wealth for that day
and the house had been brought up to date in
the fashion of that time when the finer harmonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of the antique were not as yet appreciated.
Plate glass windows had replaced the small
panes, hard wood floors covered the fine oak
planking and varnished inside shutters had supplanted
the dignified panelling of the originals.
But our aesthetic appreciations, like those of our
elders, noticed no incongruity. To us the old
house was the acme of contemporary good taste,
as well as the abode of comfort and even luxury.</p>

<p>It was here that Raymond's grandparents gave
their annual Christmas party for their grandson
and his friends. This was a festival famous in the
young life of that neighborhood. Its celebrity
was chiefly due to the Gargantuan amount of
delightful food available. There was a tree, of
course, but the presents were of the edible,
rather than the permanent kind, and no less
appreciated on that account. Nowhere else was
there to be found such an amount and variety
of candy, fruit, ice cream, cake, nuts, raisins,
chicken salad, sandwiches, jellies, jams, <i>pâté de
foies gras</i>, and other pleasing forms of
nourishment&mdash;to say nothing of lemonade and various
kinds of "shrub"&mdash;as at Raymond's Christmas
party. At the close of each of these events it did
not seem that we could ever eat again, yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
was a certain assurance of the continuance of the
fête in carrying home a paper bag containing
an orange, an apple and a generous selection of
sweets.</p>

<p>After the assembly had been fed there were
games&mdash;"Drop the Handkerchief," "Still Pond,
No More Moving," that perennial juvenile
pastime where the participants chant the memorable
chorus beginning "Oats, peas, beans and
barley grow," and sometimes, much against the
sentiments of the boys, that embarrassing game
where the player who became "It" was compelled
to "Bow to the wittiest, kneel to the prettiest
and kiss the one you love best." The boys
decided early in their social experience that no
self-respecting male ought to play this game and
it soon fell into disrepute, though the girls fought
for its continuance for a time.</p>

<p>Youthful spirits rise with food as rapidly as
does a thermometer under the sun's rays and a
good deal of noise and romping invariably accompanied
these games. Raymond's dear old
grandfather and grandmother enjoyed all these
manifestations of young life as keenly, so far
as we could see, as did the children themselves,
but Uncle Horace, it was evident, did not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
noise and confusion. Memory pictures him
standing in the background of the party, as in
the background of life, a quiet spectator, blinking
shortsightedly but not unkindly, through
his big spectacles, and vanishing altogether as
the excitement increased.</p>

<p>Once one of the youthful guests, while the
festivities were at their height, wandered into a
remote part of the house in search of some accessory
required for an approaching game and
entered by a rear door a room where Uncle Horace
had been reading. He had put his book down
in his easy chair and was now discovered standing
in the other doorway, his back to the room.</p>

<p>An intense curiosity to look at one of Uncle
Horace's learned volumes took possession of the
interloper and at that age it did not occur to him
that delicacy might demand some hesitation.
He tiptoed over to the chair expecting to see on
the cushion some calf-bound, ancient tome
written in characters that were hieroglyphics to
him. But a complete reversal of his ideas about
Uncle Horace was at hand. The book that lay
there was in blue-and-gold cloth binding and
was a copy of the first edition of "Huckleberry
Finn."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The intruder looked in some astonishment at
the spare figure of Raymond's uncle and perceived
that there was no danger of discovery for
the attitude was that of a man completely
absorbed. He was listening intently. At this distance
the general hubbub was softened and there
was a rather wistful quality in the childish voices
rising and falling with the lilting old refrain:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Thus the farmer sows his seeds.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thus he stands and takes his ease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Stamps his foot (bang!) and claps his hand (smack!)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And looks around to view the land."</span><br />
</div>

<p>After the lapse of a good many years it is this
picture of Raymond's Uncle Horace that is the
most vivid. There was some implication in the
listening figure, with head slightly bowed, one
hand resting on the casing of the doorway, that
carried, even to a childish mind, a suggestion of
hitherto unsuspected aspects of the rather
lonely widower's personality. At the time it was
all very vague and unformulated and later speculation
has hesitated somewhat before the privacy
thus unwittingly invaded. Yet afterward one
could not help at least wondering what visions
of his own childhood he saw as he listened to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
silly old lines of the ancient folk game, handed
down through so many generations and bearing
their little testimony to the continuity of experience.</p>

<p>A tardy sense of eavesdropping awoke at last
in the youthful visitor's mind&mdash;an understanding
that he did not belong there. He slipped out as
quietly as he had entered, but he took with him
a dawning appreciation of a new incarnation of
Raymond's Uncle Horace.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a><br /><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a><br /><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIII: The Fabric of a Dream</h2>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"<i>And that night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a dream of that place came to
Florian, a dream which did for him the office of a finer sort
of memory, bringing its object to mind with a great clearness,
yet, as sometimes happens in dreams, raised a little above
itself, and above ordinary retrospect. The true aspect of the
place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the fashion of its doors, its hearths, its windows,

season.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>"</p>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Child in the House.</span><br />
</div><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>COUSIN MARY'S home was a little, old,
brick house standing flush with the street.
A woodshed where the cat slept in summer extended
easterly from the house and in the angle
thus formed was a diminutive garden where such
old-fashioned flowers as holly-hocks, bachelors'
buttons, sweet william and larkspur seemed to
bloom earlier and last longer than elsewhere.</div>

<p>Everything about Cousin Mary's home was on
a small scale. She herself was a very small and
slight old lady, but she had inherited from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
hardy New England race from which she sprang
a certain tradition of vitality and longevity
which she lived long enough to exemplify in her
own person. Other family legends of uncomfortable
eccentricity and general worrisomeness
she utterly disproved, for never was there a
kindlier or more placid soul than she.</p>

<p>Of course she wore a cap with lavender ribbons
and gowns of black bombazine for every
day and black silk with lace at the throat for
great occasions. She seldom ventured out of
doors, except into her garden, or, on such annual
celebrations as Thanksgiving and Christmas, to
a neighboring relative's home where she was with
difficulty persuaded to take at dinner a glass of
port or Madeira, though she always protested
that she did not really need it. Most of her life
was spent in the southeast downstairs sitting-room,
where she used to sit in the smallest, oldest
rocking-chair ever seen. On memorable occasions
she would take possession of the kitchen, against
the protests of Drusilla, her companion, and
make gingerbread that was famous in the neighborhood,
especially among the children.</p>

<p>To childish imaginations there always seemed
something mysterious about the rooms in Cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Mary's house&mdash;doubtless merely because we
never visited them,&mdash;except the sitting-room
and the kitchen. The sitting-room communicated
with another room&mdash;I think it was called the
"parlor"&mdash;by folding doors. These were generally
open, but in there the blinds were always
closed and the room was in a kind of perpetual
dusky twilight. We could dimly see within,
but no recollection of entering remains, though
there is a faint memory of an obscure marble-topped
center-table&mdash;were there not wax flowers
on it under a glass cover?&mdash;and ancient mahogany
chairs.</p>

<p>We never reached the upper floors, at least
till after Cousin Mary's death, when it seems as
if there was an expedition to the attic in company
with some older person of authority. It was a
brief and somewhat nervous experience. Those
were the days when all ghost stories might possibly
be true and the attic, like the "parlor," was
dark. The visit was long enough to leave only a
memory of dim corners, piles of old horse-hide
trunks, a remarkable collection of ancient cooking
utensils adapted for use over the open fires
of colonial and Revolutionary days&mdash;where, we
wonder, has all this old kitchen equipage gone?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>&mdash;and
rafters from which hung dried roots and
leaves of one kind and another. It was a distinct
relief to get out of doors again.</p>

<p>But of course the mysterious qualities we attributed
to certain precincts of Cousin Mary's
house existed entirely in our youthful minds.
No one could be imagined who had less to conceal
than this serene old lady. Yet it was natural
that there should be romantic stories about her.</p>

<p>She had never married and it was not strange
that speculations about her past should concern
themselves with early love affairs. These fancies
crystallized into the quite customary tradition
that she had been engaged in her early youth to
a young man whose future was then so uncertain
that her parents objected to the match. The
years have dimmed recollection of the details of
the story&mdash;there were other romantic complications&mdash;but
at all events the young man afterwards
married another and lived to disprove the
early doubts of sceptical parents as to his chance
of success in life. But Cousin Mary remained
true to her early love.</p>

<p>Many years after her death one of the children
who used occasionally to call upon her, and to
whom even now the odor of certain old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
flowers will bring back a vivid picture of that
little garden, had a curious dream about her.</p>

<p>He was again in that familiar sitting-room,
but in some way he was invisible to the other
two occupants. One was of course Cousin Mary&mdash;but
quite a different Cousin Mary. Youth had
come back to her. She was a young girl again&mdash;and
one of the prettiest young girls the dreamer
had ever seen. Her hair was dressed high at the
back of her head. A great comb was in it. Curls
hung down over her cheeks, as sitting in the
familiar diminutive rocking-chair she bent her
head forward listening to the words of her visitor.
Old lace was about her throat which was of a
singular whiteness and beauty. Her gown was
of some shimmering stuff, high-waisted, with
many flounces. Her whole figure gave the beholder
a sense of delicate and rather fragile
beauty. She was a creature of race&mdash;a thoroughbred.</p>

<p>Seated close before her and talking softly and
eagerly was a good-looking young man in the
uniform of a naval officer of, I should guess, the
period of the second war with Great Britain.
His sword and cap lay on the floor beside his
chair.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Incongruities in dreams are generally accepted
without surprise, but in this case the
sleeper afterward recalled a sense of astonishment
at the character of this stranger. Who was
he? So far as was known no sailor had ever
been associated with Cousin Mary's life.</p>

<p>Even in dreams a sense of the proprieties
sometimes follows one and it was evident to the
dreamer that his presence was superfluous. He
turned to the dark "parlor" and for the first
time entered.</p>

<p>It was a queer place. All sorts of curios from
the East were scattered about it&mdash;yet "scattered"
is not the right word for there was a
method in the arrangement, grotesque though
it was. The dreamer, however, had little opportunity
to observe all this for he was drawn
at once to a corner where was a strange, spiral
staircase, built of some light Indian wood, and
leading through the ceiling to the story above.
He ascended and emerged into the unknown
region overhead.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful place. The details are gone&mdash;one
recalls only an impression of happiness,
sunshine, scents of exotic flowers, the singing of
innumerable birds, the tinkling sound of a hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
fountain. It was no longer a room&mdash;it was
a new country. Here, it seemed, dwelt peace,
content, beauty. A fragment of a familiar poem
drifted into the dreamer's fancies&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And see the great Achilles whom we knew&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>And there was more than a sense of well-being.
There was, for a little moment, a fantastic sensation
of fulfillment in one's presence there.
There was a feeling of power. Here, one was
somehow assured, ambitions would be accomplished,
hopes would come true. Here could be
done the things one always wanted to do.</p>

<p>The dreamer wished to go on, to explore, to
find the happy secret of this region, but this, for
some reason, was denied him. Some all-powerful
influence compelled him to go back, to descend
the little staircase into the darkened parlor.</p>

<p>Standing there he looked through the open
folding doors into the well-known sitting-room
and the picture he saw halted him.</p>

<p>Cousin Mary and her sailor lover were standing
in the middle of the room. His arms were
about her, her hands were on his shoulders, her
face raised to his.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost as soon as it was perceived the vision
began to fade, receding slowly into the formless,
tenuous clouds of semi-consciousness. In a
moment the sleeper awoke. For an instant it was
difficult to disassociate from the spirit of his
dream the golden light of the early spring morning,
the twittering of birds, the light drip from
the eaves of the brief rain left by the vanished
April shower.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The later history of the spot where Cousin
Mary dwelt offers its commentary on a fast
changing civilization. Soon after her death the
little brick house was pulled down and the cubic
space it occupied was filled with heavy machinery
which daily filled with its reverberations this
place which was once the very epitome of quietude.
Now, in their turn, the huge presses have
given way to one corner of a vast office building
where an army of busy clerks pursues the urgent
and exacting routine of a great corporation.</p>

<p>The Latin poets liked to believe that every
locality had its own peculiar divinity&mdash;the
"genius of the place." What has become of the
goddess who for so long dedicated to peacefulness
this abode of a benign old age? Is it that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was so closely identified with the one who dwelt
there that when that life ceased the guardian
angel fled with the departing spirit to some still
fairer abode&mdash;or is the genius of the place really
called Memory, who, in the minds of those who
cherish her, effectually preserves against any
merely material desecration the places she once
held dear?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a><br /><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a><br /><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a><br /><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIV: The Quiet Life</h2>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"<i>More than half a century of life has taught me that most
of the wrong and folly which darkens earth is due to those
who cannot possess their souls in quiet; that most of the good
which saves mankind from destruction comes of life that is
led in thoughtful stillness.</i>"</p>

</div><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WITH the thoughtless cruelty of childhood
we used to call him "Thermometer"
Tatlock because he was forever watching the
temperature. The tradition was that whenever
he went down cellar to look at the furnace he
arrayed himself in overcoat, fur cap, muffler and
arctics. Nicknames are not always brutal and
the cruelty of this case lay only in the peculiar
features of the situation&mdash;the fact, in short, that
the subject of our joke was such a gentle, retiring,
almost apologetic old gentleman. He was deprecatory
even toward us children. To adult
reflection it seems ruthless to have made any
fun of him at all.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet there was no doubt about the fact that he
was an odd character. The incarnation of bashfulness,
he was, like most bashful persons, persistent
and consistent in doing just exactly as
he liked so far as the demands of a world, not
primarily constituted for people of his stripe,
allowed. It must be confessed that, in modern
parlance, he got away with it pretty successfully.</p>

<p>Probably this was because he was wise enough
not to demand very much. It did not seem that
either the rise and fall of nations or of the stock
market gave him very much concern. Doubtless
he did not disturb himself greatly over the question
of who was to be the next president. His
chief worry seemed to be the weather, though
why he should have troubled himself about this,
when most of his life was spent indoors, remains
a mystery. Memory seems to recall some story
of ill-health in early life which perhaps inculcated
a habit of consulting weather conditions that
lasted as long as life itself&mdash;and he lived to a
green old age.</p>

<p>The spacious brick mansion that was his home
stood sideways, as it were, to the street, behind
a tall fence with panelled posts and blunt,
rounded pickets, like large broomsticks of alternating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
heights. Both the main front door and
what we should now call the service entrance
were reached by a gravelled driveway with a
flag walk beside it that terminated around in the
rear of the house at the stable. Narrow flights
of steps with wrought-iron railings, topped here
and there with brass balls, led to the two doors.</p>

<p>The entrance hall was almost square, a passage
way running off toward the kitchen from
the left-hand farther corner and the staircase
ascending on one's left as one entered. At the
landing, halfway up, was a large window, opening
to the north, which illumined the hall and
stair-well with an even, rather bare light. Somewhere
in the wall was a recess in which stood a
bust of Cicero, of which the eyes, formed without
indication of the pupils after the fashion of its
period of sculpture, gave an effect of blindness
fascinating to the childish imagination.</p>

<p>On the right was a little room where Mr. Tatlock's
sister, a dear old lady who always wore a
little flat lace cap with a black bow, generally
sat knitting. Straight ahead was the parlor
where occasionally, when Mr. Tatlock's niece
was visiting at the house, there were subdued
children's parties. On these occasions he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
never visible. His own room was the library,
east of the parlor, with a southern exposure toward
the garden.</p>

<p>Here we never entered, but once or twice we
caught a glimpse of the interior through the door
left unguardedly open by some momentary
oversight. The picture thus presented had as
its background the south wall of the room with
its two windows between which stood the chimney
piece. Above the mantle, which was supported
by miniature Ionic columns, hung a portrait
of a gentleman with a great deal of hair and
shirt frill, and below a bright fire burned, partly
concealed by a fire screen, beside which, reading
in a large easy chair, was Mr. Tatlock. Recollection
is still vivid of the startled, rather furtive
glance, the look of a timid animal whose place
of refuge had been discovered, directed toward
us as we peeked in.</p>

<p>What was the old man reading as he sat there
day after day and year after year, while presidents
were elected, national policies inaugurated
and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'abondoned'">abandoned</ins>, the maps of the world changed
here and there, automobiles invented, and the
children grew up, went to college, got married
and left the old street? Probably no one knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
for a certainty, but we should be willing to guess
that his favorites were Burke, the Spectator,
Boswell's Johnson, Pope, Charles Lamb, Leigh
Hunt and perhaps Gibbon. Did he, we wonder,
ever read a novel? If so, it is doubtful whether
he got much beyond Jane Austen and Mrs.
Gaskell.</p>

<p>The house had a lovely old garden that stretched
away to the east, down a slope that was broken
into two or three terraces. At the eastward end
was a level portion where the box-lined gravel
walk from the house made a circle around an old
oak tree under which was a bench. There were
a good many old fashioned flowers and shrubs in
the garden and some pear trees, but who took
care of the pruning and gardening, except Mr
Tatlock's sister who assuredly could not do it
all, is still unexplained.</p>

<p>There was a hired man whom we called "Mister"
O'Neil who sometimes went to the post
office and may have done other errands, but as
his title implies he seems to have been above
gardening. At any rate there is no recollection of
seeing him at work in the garden. In spite of his
name there was nothing in his appearance that
indicated Irish extraction. He was not a hired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
man at all in the New England sense; he was
more the type of the confidential servant of the
English novelists. He was dark, wore a beard,
dressed habitually in black and looked like a
particularly doleful undertaker.</p>

<p>We never saw Mr. Tatlock and "Mister"
O'Neil together and yet imagination&mdash;perhaps
it is only imagination&mdash;somehow groups them as
a pair of confidants. In a way their characteristics
were similar. Both were inscrutable, quiet
persons, content to remain in the background.
For all of them the world might wag. In our
imaginations at least, "Mister" O'Neil knew all
about Mr. Tatlock. He accepted the other's
peculiar reticences, so like his own, as a matter
of course; he knew his innocent secrets; he even
could tell, if he wished, what books he read there
before the fire that burned from September to
June. With this taciturn individual we doubted
if Mr. Tatlock was bashful. Possibly their
mutual congeniality of temperament centered
about the furnace, for they both watched it.</p>

<p>"Mister" O'Neil could have revealed, we believe,
what the shock was that we all decided
Mr. Tatlock must have received early in life.
The girls were convinced that this shock was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
emotional&mdash;an unhappy love affair, or the death
of some dear friend. The boys, on the other
hand, were inclined to talk about a purely physical
catastrophe&mdash;a runaway accident, perhaps,
or a blow on the head from a highway robber.
For all of these surmises we had not the slightest
foundation, except in fancy, and mature reflection
leads to the conclusion that probably we
were entirely in error. It seems now much more
likely that this old bachelor's oddities were due
to life-long frail health.</p>

<p>And yet one can never be sure and somehow
one glimpse of Mr. Tatlock which it was permitted
one of the children to catch hinted, inexplicably
and without any particular warrant,
at other possibilities. It was the only out-of-door
memory of him that is left. The boy,
who still remembers well that spring day, was in
the next yard, hanging over the fence looking
into Mr. Tatlock's garden when he suddenly
became aware that Mr. Tatlock himself was
sitting on the bench in the circle the path made
around the old tree. The old gentleman did not
see the small spectator who had been betrayed
into an unaccustomed quietness by the absence
of companions and some subtle and unacknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
influence of the first warm afternoon of the
year.</p>

<p>Nothing whatever happened, Mr. Tatlock
sat there, looking up from time to time at the
young leaves above him, tapping his stick on the
soft turf and smiling to himself. Of what long-gone
springs was he dreaming? It was clear
that whatever his thoughts were, they were
happy ones.</p>

<p>Probably to most boys the ideal life is one that
comprises "the joy of eventful living." Here for
the first time it dawned upon this youthful interloper
that one could be happy in quietness and
seclusion. There were, it appeared, certain
satisfactions in other careers than those of the
cowboy and the soldier. Up to this time the boy
had never been able to understand why heaven
was so often spoken of as a place of rest. He did
not understand wholly now, but a later comprehension
had here its inception.</p>

<p>And so let us remember Mr. Tatlock sitting,
lost in meditation, in his garden. After all he was
not without influence in his environment, unobtrusive
soul that he was. He made himself
felt in his little world. He counted. The boy who
watched him over the fence that day thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
him again when he read in a recent essay: "The
truth is that a man's life is the expression of his
temperament and that what eventually matters
is his attitude and relation to life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not
only his performance."</p>
